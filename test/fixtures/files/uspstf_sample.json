These screening strategies include 1) annual screening with FIT, 2) screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and annual screening with FIT, 3) screening every 10 years with colonoscopy, and 4) screening every 5 years with CT colonography. The findings for CT colonography depend on the proxy measure used for the burden of screening (number of lifetime colonoscopies or lifetime cathartic bowel preparations). Two of the 3 CISNET models found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years (as recommended by the manufacturer) was estimated to yield life-years gained less than 90% of the colonoscopy screening strategy (84% and 87%, respectively). Another way to conceptualize these findings is to note that CISNET modeling found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years was estimated to provide about the same amount of benefit as screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 years (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig\">Figure</a>).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a><br><br>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#tab\">Table</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>lists the various screening tests for colorectal cancer and notes potential frequency of use as well as additional considerations for each method.

Risk factors for MDD in children and adolescents include female sex; older age; family (especially maternal) history of depression; prior episode of depression; other mental health or behavioral problems; chronic medical illness; overweight and obesity; and, in some studies, Hispanic race/ethnicity. Other psychosocial risk factors include childhood abuse or neglect, exposure to traumatic events (including natural disasters), loss of a loved one or romantic relationship, family conflict, uncertainty about sexual orientation, low socioeconomic status, and poor academic performance.",

Women, young and middle-aged adults, and nonwhite persons have higher rates of depression than their counterparts, as do persons who are undereducated, previously married, or unemployed. Other groups who are at increased risk of developing depression include persons with chronic illnesses (eg, cancer or cardiovascular disease), other mental health disorders (including substance misuse), or a family history of psychiatric disorders. Among older adults, risk factors for depression include disability and poor health status related to medical illness, complicated grief, chronic sleep disturbance, loneliness, and a history of depression. However, the presence or absence of risk factors alone cannot distinguish patients with depression from those without depression. Risk factors for depression during pregnancy and postpartum include poor self-esteem, child-care stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress, decreased social support, single/unpartnered relationship status, history of depression, difficult infant temperament, previous postpartum depression, lower socioeconomic status, and unintended pregnancy.",

Another important risk factor for HBV infection is lack of vaccination in infancy in U.S.-born persons with parents from a country or region with high prevalence (&ge;8%), such as sub-Saharan Africa, central and southeast Asia, and China (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrsfig.htm\">Figure</a>). Because HBV infection prevalence may gradually change over time, it is important to note that some countries and regions with prevalence rates between 5-7% are considered to be highly endemic areas.&nbsp;<br><br>The CDC also recommends screening in persons receiving hemodialysis or cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy (for example, chemotherapy for malignant diseases and immunosuppression related to organ transplantation and for rheumatologic and gastroenterologic disorders). <br><br>Some persons with combinations of risk factors who are not members of one of these risk factor groups may also be at increased risk for HBV infection. However, reliable information about combinations of risk factors is not available. Clinicians should exercise their judgment in deciding whether these persons are at sufficiently high risk to warrant screening. For example, screening is probably appropriate in settings that treat a large proportion of persons at increased risk, such as clinics for sexually transmitted infections; HIV testing and treatment centers; health care settings that provide services for injection drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; and institutions that serve populations from countries with a high prevalence of infection, including community health centers. <br><br>The prevalence of HBV infection is low in the general U.S. population, and most infected persons do not develop complications. Therefore, screening is not recommended in those who are not at increased risk. The USPSTF notes that high rates of HBV infection have been found in cities and other areas with high numbers of immigrants or migrant persons from Asia or the Pacific Islands or their adult children.

However, clinicians&rsquo; ability to accurately identify a patient&rsquo;s true risk is imperfect, because the best currently available risk estimation tool, which uses the Pooled Cohort Equations from the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines on the assessment of cardiovascular risk,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> has been shown to overestimate actual risk in multiple external validation cohorts.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation2\"><span>2-4</span></a></sup> The reasons for this possible overestimation are still unclear. The Pooled Cohort Equations were derived from prospective cohorts of volunteers from studies conducted in the 1990s and may not be generalizable to a more contemporary and diverse patient population seen in current clinical practice. Furthermore, no statin clinical trials enrolled patients based on a specific risk threshold calculated using a CVD risk prediction tool; rather, patients had 1 or more CVD risk factors other than age and sex as a requirement for trial enrollment.</p>\r\n<p>Because the Pooled Cohort Equations lack precision, the risk estimation tool should be used as a starting point to discuss with patients their desire for lifelong statin therapy. The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on his or her absolute baseline risk of having a future CVD event, a risk estimation that is imprecise based on the currently available risk estimation tool. Thus, clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin use. Patients who place a higher value on the potential benefits than on the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a daily medication may choose to initiate statin use for reduction of CVD risk. The USPSTF has made several other recommendations relevant to the prevention of CVD in adults (see the &ldquo;Other Approaches to Prevention&rdquo; section).</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration </strong></h2>\r\n<p>These recommendations apply to adults 40 years and older without a history of CVD who do not have current signs and symptoms of CVD (ie, symptomatic coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke). Some individuals in this group may have undetected, asymptomatic atherosclerotic changes; for the purposes of this recommendation statement, the USPSTF considers these persons to be candidates for primary prevention interventions. These recommendations do not apply to adults with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) or known familial hypercholesterolemia; these persons are considered to have very high cholesterol levels and may require statin use.</p>",

Women at greater risk, such as those with at least a 3% risk for breast cancer in the next 5 years, are likely to derive more benefit than harm from risk-reducing medications6 and should be offered these medications if their risk of harms is low. Some women at lower risk for breast cancer have also been included in trials documenting reduced risk for breast cancer when taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors.3, 4 However, when balancing the harms associated with these medications, the net benefit will be lower among women at lower risk.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Alternatively, clinicians may use combinations of risk factors (including some risk factors not included in risk assessment tools but that would have permitted enrollment in some of the risk reduction trials) to identify women at increased risk. Some examples of combinations of multiple risk factors in women at increased risk include (but are not limited to) age 65 years or older with 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer; 45 years or older with more than 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer or 1 first-degree relative who developed breast cancer before age 50 years; 40 years or older with a first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer; presence of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ on a prior biopsy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Women not at increased risk for breast cancer, such as women younger than 60 years with no additional risk factors for breast cancer, or women with a low 5-year risk of breast cancer should not be routinely offered medications to reduce risk of breast cancer, since the risk of harms from these medications likely outweighs their potential benefit.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>When considering prescribing breast cancer risk-reducing medications, potential benefit of risk reduction of breast cancer must be balanced against the potential harms of adverse medication effects. See below for more information on potential harms from risk-reducing medications.</span></p>",

These screening strategies include 1) annual screening with FIT, 2) screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and annual screening with FIT, 3) screening every 10 years with colonoscopy, and 4) screening every 5 years with CT colonography. The findings for CT colonography depend on the proxy measure used for the burden of screening (number of lifetime colonoscopies or lifetime cathartic bowel preparations). Two of the 3 CISNET models found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years (as recommended by the manufacturer) was estimated to yield life-years gained less than 90% of the colonoscopy screening strategy (84% and 87%, respectively). Another way to conceptualize these findings is to note that CISNET modeling found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years was estimated to provide about the same amount of benefit as screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 years (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig\">Figure</a>).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a><br><br><br>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#tab\">Table</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>lists the various screening tests for colorectal cancer and notes potential frequency of use as well as additional considerations for each method.

Clinicians may choose to offer a low- to moderate-dose statin to certain adults without a history of CVD when all of the following criteria are met: 1) they are aged 40 to 75 years; 2) they have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking); and 3) they have a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5% to 10%.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Considerations for Implementation </strong></h2>\r\n<p>To determine whether a patient is a candidate for statin therapy, clinicians must first determine the patient&rsquo;s risk of having a future CVD event. However, clinicians&rsquo; ability to accurately identify a patient&rsquo;s true risk is imperfect, because the best currently available risk estimation tool, which uses the Pooled Cohort Equations from the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines on the assessment of cardiovascular risk,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> has been shown to overestimate actual risk in multiple external validation cohorts.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation2\"><span>2-4</span></a></sup> The reasons for this possible overestimation are still unclear. The Pooled Cohort Equations were derived from prospective cohorts of volunteers from studies conducted in the 1990s and may not be generalizable to a more contemporary and diverse patient population seen in current clinical practice. Furthermore, no statin clinical trials enrolled patients based on a specific risk threshold calculated using a CVD risk prediction tool; rather, patients had 1 or more CVD risk factors other than age and sex as a requirement for trial enrollment.</p>\r\n<p>Because the Pooled Cohort Equations lack precision, the risk estimation tool should be used as a starting point to discuss with patients their desire for lifelong statin therapy. The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on his or her absolute baseline risk of having a future CVD event, a risk estimation that is imprecise based on the currently available risk estimation tool. Thus, clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin use. Patients who place a higher value on the potential benefits than on the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a daily medication may choose to initiate statin use for reduction of CVD risk. The USPSTF has made several other recommendations relevant to the prevention of CVD in adults (see the &ldquo;Other Approaches to Prevention&rdquo; section).</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration </strong></h2>\r\n<p>These recommendations apply to adults 40 years and older without a history of CVD who do not have current signs and symptoms of CVD (ie, symptomatic coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke). Some individuals in this group may have undetected, asymptomatic atherosclerotic changes; for the purposes of this recommendation statement, the USPSTF considers these persons to be candidates for primary prevention interventions. These recommendations do not apply to adults with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) or known familial hypercholesterolemia; these persons are considered to have very high cholesterol levels and may require statin use.</p>",

Most participants enrolled in trials of statin use for the prevention of CVD had an LDL-C level of 130 to 190 mg/dL or a diabetes diagnosis; hypertension and smoking were also common among trial participants.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> Persons with an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL were usually excluded from trial participation, as it was not considered appropriate to randomly assign them to placebo.

Higher prevalence and severity of dental caries are found among minority and economically disadvantaged children. Other risk factors for caries in children include frequent sugar exposure, inappropriate bottle feeding, developmental defects of the tooth enamel, dry mouth, and a history of previous caries. Maternal and family factors can also increase children's risk. These factors include poor oral hygiene, low socioeconomic status, recent maternal caries, sibling caries, and frequent snacking. Additional factors associated with dental caries in young children include lack of access to dental care; inadequate preventive measures, such as failure to use fluoride-containing toothpastes; and lack of parental knowledge about oral health.",

However, clinicians&rsquo; ability to accurately identify a patient&rsquo;s true risk is imperfect, because the best currently available risk estimation tool, which uses the Pooled Cohort Equations from the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines on the assessment of cardiovascular risk,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> has been shown to overestimate actual risk in multiple external validation cohorts.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation2\"><span>2-4</span></a></sup> The reasons for this possible overestimation are still unclear. The Pooled Cohort Equations were derived from prospective cohorts of volunteers from studies conducted in the 1990s and may not be generalizable to a more contemporary and diverse patient population seen in current clinical practice. Furthermore, no statin clinical trials enrolled patients based on a specific risk threshold calculated using a CVD risk prediction tool; rather, patients had 1 or more CVD risk factors other than age and sex as a requirement for trial enrollment.</p>\r\n<p>Because the Pooled Cohort Equations lack precision, the risk estimation tool should be used as a starting point to discuss with patients their desire for lifelong statin therapy. The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on his or her absolute baseline risk of having a future CVD event, a risk estimation that is imprecise based on the currently available risk estimation tool. Thus, clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin use. Patients who place a higher value on the potential benefits than on the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a daily medication may choose to initiate statin use for reduction of CVD risk. The USPSTF has made several other recommendations relevant to the prevention of CVD in adults (see the &ldquo;Other Approaches to Prevention&rdquo; section).</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration </strong></h2>\r\n<p>These recommendations apply to adults 40 years and older without a history of CVD who do not have current signs and symptoms of CVD (ie, symptomatic coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke). Some individuals in this group may have undetected, asymptomatic atherosclerotic changes; for the purposes of this recommendation statement, the USPSTF considers these persons to be candidates for primary prevention interventions. These recommendations do not apply to adults with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) or known familial hypercholesterolemia; these persons are considered to have very high cholesterol levels and may require statin use.</p>",

      "title": "Bladder Cancer ",
      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\nBladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the United States. It is the seventh-leading cause of solid cancer-related deaths. An estimated 70,980 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed in the United States during 2009 (52,810 cases in men and 18,170 cases in women), and approximately 14,330 people died of the disease (10,180 men and 4150 women). More than 90% of all cases of bladder cancer are classified as transitional cell carcinomas. Most newly diagnosed transitional cell carcinomas present as superficial tumors. The stages of bladder cancer include superficial (Ta or T1) and muscle-invasive tumors. Many superficial tumors (50% to 70%) will recur after treatment, with a 10% to 20% risk for the tumor to progress to the invasive stage. One fourth of all cases of bladder cancer and 20% to 40% of all invasive tumors have already metastasized to the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. Invasive bladder cancer is associated with a poor prognosis.\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\nThe evidence is inadequate regarding the diagnostic accuracy of potential tests (urinalysis for microscopic hematuria, urine cytology, or tests for urine biomarkers) for identifying bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons with no history of bladder cancer.\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for bladder cancer or treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer leads to improved disease-specific or overall morbidity or mortality.\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>\r\nScreening may yield false-positive results. False-positive results may lead to anxiety, labeling, pain, and additional complications that result from diagnostic cystoscopy and biopsy (such as bladder perforation, bleeding, and infection) or imaging. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for bladder cancer. Evidence on the harms associated with early treatment, which may occur more frequently with greater detection of cases of early-stage cancer, is also inadequate.\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults.",
      "clinical": "<p>In 2004, the USPSTF recommended against routine screening for bladder cancer in adults because the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweighed the benefits of screening (D recommendation). In 2009, the USPSTF performed a targeted literature review and found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer. In 2004, the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweighed the benefits; however, this time the USPSTF reviewed mortality statistics and other epidemiologic data that suggested heretofore undemonstrated benefits of screening. As a result, the USPSTF changed its recommendation from a D to an I statement (insufficient evidence).</p>\r\n<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults. Although adults with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (such as urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency, dysuria, or nocturia) are not strictly asymptomatic, these symptoms are quite common and are not believed to be associated with an increased risk for bladder cancer. The USPSTF considered it reasonable to include these persons in the population under consideration for screening. Adults with gross hematuria or acute changes in lower urinary tract symptoms are not included in this population.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Primary care-feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include identifying hematuria with a urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Once bladder cancer has been diagnosed, several factors determine treatment, including tumor grade, cancer stage (superficial vs. invasive), whether the tumor is recurrent, the patient's age and overall health status, and patient and physician preferences. The principal treatment for superficial (Ta or T1) bladder cancer is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, which may be combined with adjuvant radiation therapy, intravesical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photodynamic therapies. Radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, is used in cases of surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen for bladder cancer, clinicians should consider the following.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>\r\n<p>Bladder cancer is similar to many other types of cancer in that it is a heterogeneous condition. Approximately 70% of all cases of newly diagnosed transitional cell carcinomas present as superficial tumors (including in situ); some of these tumors may never progress to advanced disease. However, some cases of bladder cancer invade the muscle tissue, progress, and metastasize; treatment has limited efficacy in these cases. Early detection of tumors with malignant potential may have an important effect on the mortality rate of bladder cancer. One challenge of screening for bladder cancer is accurately identifying cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) with a high risk for progression. Another area of uncertainty is determining whether providing earlier, less toxic treatment (such as immunotherapy) with the intention of preventing symptomatic progression results in fewer overall harms to the patient than providing more toxic treatment (such as radical cystectomy) only to those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced tumors. Persons at increased risk for bladder cancer include those who work in the rubber, chemical, or leather industries, as well as those who smoke, are male, are older, or have a family or personal history of bladder cancer.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>\r\n<p>False-positive test results may result in anxiety and unneeded evaluations, diagnostic-related harms from cystoscopy and biopsy, harms from labeling or unnecessary treatments (such as transurethral resection of a bladder tumor, intravesical chemotherapy, or biologic therapies), and overdiagnosis.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n<p>Screening tests feasible for use in primary care include urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers. Tests for urine biomarkers are not commonly used in primary care in part because of their cost, although this varies substantially. Patients with positive screening results are typically referred to a urologist for further evaluation, which may include cystoscopy (and biopsy if a tumor is found), imaging, and other studies.</p>\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Several gaps in the evidence led the USPSTF to issue an I statement. Addressing these research needs could potentially provide sufficient evidence for the USPSTF to issue future screening recommendations. Cohort studies are needed to evaluate the natural history of early-stage, untreated bladder cancer (particularly that detected by screening) to allow a greater understanding of the potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with screen-detected bladder cancer. Studies that compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine screening tests in representative populations are needed, as well as studies that assess the effect of screening on the incidence of bladder cancer, tumor characteristics, and subsequent treatments. Randomized, controlled trials or well-designed case-control studies that evaluate clinical outcomes in screened versus unscreened populations, which would provide direct evidence on benefits and harms of screening, have highest priority. Targeting populations at increased risk for bladder cancer because of patient characteristics or occupational exposure may be preferred to enhance feasibility and maximize clinical relevance. A better understanding of the harms related to screening and treatment are required. Methods for evaluating these harms could include conducting observational studies based on patient registries or large pharmacoepidemiologic databases. As noted, prospective cohort studies are needed to more accurately identify cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) with a high risk for progression. Future research should also clarify the trade-offs of using less-toxic treatments earlier and more frequently, to prevent symptomatic progression, versus using treatments with greater toxicity, which are typically reserved for those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced tumors.</p>",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>The incidence of bladder cancer in the United States is approximately 21 cases per 100,000 persons or 0.02%. It is the seventh-leading cause of death due to solid cancer in the United States. In 2009, an estimated 70,980 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed, and approximately 14,330 people died of the disease. In comparison, in 2009 there were an estimated 219,440 new cases of lung cancer and 159,390 deaths, 146,970 new cases of colorectal cancer and 49,920 deaths, 192,280 new cases of prostate cancer and 27,360 deaths, and 11,270 new cases of cervical cancer and 4070 deaths.</p>\r\n<p>Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous condition with a variable natural history. It also has a relatively low mortality rate relative to the incidence of new cases. As a result, risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment is a major issue in bladder cancer screening. Thus, it is important to identify superficial tumors that are at high risk for progression and target treatment at an earlier, more treatable stage in persons with such tumors, while minimizing unnecessary treatments in those unlikely to have disease-specific morbidity or mortality.</p>\r\n<p>Persons at increased risk for bladder cancer include those who smoke or have occupational exposure to carcinogens, such as those who work in the rubber, chemical, or leather industries. Other risk factors for bladder cancer include male sex, older age, white race, infections caused by certain bladder parasites, and a family or personal history of bladder cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2004 recommendation on screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons, the USPSTF reviewed the current state of the evidence and identified new evidence that addresses previously identified gaps. The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, the accuracy of primary care-feasible screening tests, and the benefits and harms of treatment.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Primary care-feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include urinalysis for hematuria, urinary cytology, and tests for other urine biomarkers. No evidence was found regarding the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic persons.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence that bladder cancer screening is associated with improved health outcomes compared with no screening. The USPSTF could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for screen-detected bladder cancer because of a lack of studies that compare clinical outcomes associated with treatment versus no treatment.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms associated with bladder cancer screening. In screening studies, the positive predictive value of various tests was less than 10%, which suggests a significant burden of unnecessary follow-up procedures and associated harms. However, the USPSTF found no reliable data with which to estimate the incremental harms associated with screening for bladder cancer compared with no screening, or the harms associated with treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer versus no treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for bladder cancer include false-positive test results and unnecessary subsequent diagnostic procedures, as well as earlier initiation of routine surveillance. Follow-up of positive screening results typically includes cystoscopy and may include imaging studies. Potential harms include anxiety, labeling, discomfort or pain related to cystoscopy, and complications related to cystoscopy and biopsy (such as perforation, bleeding, or infection) or imaging (such as adverse effects related to the use of intravenous contrast).</p>\r\n<p>In lower-prevalence populations, more patients are potentially exposed to unnecessary harms because of a higher rate of false-positive results than in higher-prevalence populations.</p>\r\n<p>One large, uncontrolled observational study of 2821 patients reported bleeding and perforation in 2.8% and 1.3%, respectively, of patients who underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. However, the incremental harms that may have occurred because of screening cannot be estimated from the data. As noted, the risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment is substantial because of the relatively low mortality rate. Thus, it is important to assess the harms related to overtreating screen-detected bladder cancer that is unlikely to progress to death or disability.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for bladder cancer. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment and the harms of screening or treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening is lacking.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 30 November 2010 to 28 December 2010. Six comments were received from individuals or organizations. All comments were reviewed during the creation of this final document. Specifically, input from clinical specialists led to changes in the description of treatments. In general, the comments supported the USPSTF's specified research agenda.</p>",

      "title": "Hearing Loss in Older Adults",
      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Age-related sensorineural hearing loss is a common health problem among adults aged 50 years or older. Hearing loss can affect social functioning and quality of life.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>Convincing evidence shows that screening tools can reliably and accurately identify adults with objective hearing loss. Clinical tests used to screen for hearing impairment include testing whether a person can hear a whispered voice, a finger rub, or a watch tick at a specific distance. Perceived hearing loss can be assessed by asking a single question (for example, &ldquo;Do you have difficulty with your hearing?&rdquo;) or with a more detailed questionnaire, such as the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly&ndash;Screening Version (HHIE-S). A handheld screening instrument consisting of an otoscope with a built-in audiometer can also be used.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Because of a paucity of directly applicable trials, evidence is inadequate to determine whether screening for hearing loss improves health outcomes in persons who are unaware of hearing loss or have perceived hearing loss but have not sought care. One good-quality study showed that hearing aids can improve self-reported hearing, communication, and social functioning for some adults with age-related hearing loss. This study nearly exclusively evaluated white male veterans with moderate hearing loss and moderate to severe perceived hearing impairment, more than one third of whom had been referred for evaluation of hearing problems; as such, these findings were of limited applicability to a hypothetical asymptomatic, screened population. The only randomized trial that directly evaluated the effect of screening for hearing impairment&mdash;rather than the effect of treatment alone&mdash;was not primarily designed nor had sufficient statistical power to detect differences in hearing-related function. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is inadequate to assess the benefit of screening and early treatment in an unselected screening population.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Because of a lack of studies, evidence to determine the magnitude of harms of screening for hearing loss in older adults is inadequate; however, given the noninvasive nature of both screening and associated diagnostic evaluation, these harms are probably small to none. Adequate evidence shows that the harms of treatment of hearing loss in older adults are small to none.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for hearing loss in adults aged 50 years or older cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults aged 50 years or older. It does not apply to persons seeking evaluation for perceived hearing problems or for cognitive or affective symptoms that may be related to hearing loss. These persons should be assessed for objective hearing impairment and treated when indicated.\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\nAging is the most important risk factor for hearing loss. Presbycusis, a gradual, progressive decline in the ability to perceive high-frequency tones due to degeneration of hair cells in the ear, is the most common cause of hearing loss in older adults. However, hearing loss may result from several contributing factors. Other risk factors include a history of exposure to loud noises or ototoxic agents, including occupational exposures; previous recurring inner ear infections; genetic factors; and certain systemic diseases, such as diabetes.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nAvailable screening tests include physical diagnostic tests, such as the whispered voice, finger rub, and watch tick tests (bearing in mind that many modern watches no longer audibly tick); single-question screening or longer patient questionnaires; and handheld audiometers. All are relatively accurate and reliable screening tools for identifying adults with objective hearing loss. In addition, self-administered questionnaires, such as HHIE-S, can identify adults with perceived (or subjective) hearing difficulty. Not all adults with perceived hearing difficulty have objective hearing loss.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nBefore a person receives a hearing aid, diagnosis of objective hearing loss should be confirmed with a pure-tone audiogram. Fair evidence from studies in highly selected populations shows that hearing aids can improve self-reported hearing, communication, and social functioning for some adults with age-related hearing loss.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>\r\n<em>Potential preventable burden.</em> Finding objective hearing loss indicates eligibility for a hearing aid but does not convincingly identify persons who will find the devices helpful and wearable and will use them. One subgroup analysis of a randomized, controlled trial found that in older adults who did not have self-perceived hearing loss at study entry, screening and receipt of a free hearing aid did not increase use after 1 year compared with an unscreened control group (and overall use was low, at 0% to 1.6%). However, health-related quality of life is improved for some adults with moderate to severe hearing loss who use hearing aids compared with those who do not. <em>Cost.</em>The cost of screening varies according to the test. The cost of a questionnaire consists of the time required of both the patient and clinician. In-office clinical techniques (whispered voice, finger rub, or watch tick tests) and audiometry are quick to perform; however, handheld audiometers have up-front equipment costs. Diagnostic confirmation of a positive screen is typically done with a pure-tone audiogram, which requires a soundproof booth and trained personnel to administer the test and takes approximately 1 hour to complete. The cost of a hearing aid is a barrier to use for many older adults because it is not covered by Medicare and many private insurance companies.\r\n<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nFuture studies should concentrate on patients older than 70 years and examine whether there are differential effects of treatment on outcomes at different ages (for example, older than 70 or 80 years). Adequately powered studies are needed to better evaluate the effect of screening for hearing loss on health outcomes, such as emotional and social functioning, communication ability, and cognitive function, rather than intermediate measures, such as hearing aid use or satisfaction, particularly among adults without self-perceived or established hearing loss at baseline. The incremental benefits and costs of screening asymptomatic adults compared with only testing and treating those who seek treatment of perceived hearing impairment are unknown. Knowledge of specific factors or patient characteristics associated with increased and sustained use of hearing aids, once prescribed, could permit testing and treatment targeted to those most likely to benefit.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nThe normal human ear can process sound frequencies from 20 to 20,000 Hz, with 500 to 4000 Hz being the most important range for speech processing. There is no universally accepted definition for hearing loss because frequency and intensity thresholds vary depending on the reference criteria used. However, commonly used definitions for mild and moderate hearing loss are the inability to hear frequencies associated with speech processing at less than 25 or 40 dB of volume, respectively.The prevalence of hearing loss varies depending on the definition used, but population-based estimates range from 20% to 40% in adults older than 50 years to more than 80% in adults aged 80 years or older. Onset of sensorineural hearing loss is subtle, and individuals may therefore not recognize or report symptoms to their health care providers; comorbid medical conditions, such as cognitive impairment, may also interfere with acknowledgment of hearing deficits. Underreporting of symptoms may also occur if the person fears social stigma as a result of diagnosis. As such, the prevalence of this condition may be underestimated.Hearing loss can negatively affect a person&rsquo;s quality of life and ability to function independently. Persons with hearing loss may have difficulty with speech discrimination and localization of sounds. Hearing impairment has been shown to be associated with increased social isolation and emotional dysfunction among older adults.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF reviewed randomized, controlled trials and controlled observational studies published between 1950 and January 2010 on screening for age-related sensorineural hearing impairment in adults aged 50 years or older without diagnosed hearing loss in the primary care setting. It examined evidence on the following topics: association of screening with improved health outcomes, accuracy of screening methods, incremental benefit of early (rather than symptomatic) detection, effectiveness of treatment, and harms of screening and treatment. Congenital hearing loss, conductive hearing loss, and hearing loss due to occupational exposure or acute trauma were not included in this review.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nSeveral screening examinations for hearing loss can be used in primary care settings, including clinical testing methods (whispered voice, finger rub, and watch tick tests), single-question screening (asking, &ldquo;Do you have difficulty with your hearing?&rdquo;) or multiple-item patient questionnaires (HHIE-S), and handheld audiometers. Twenty studies, including 7 of good quality and 13 of fair quality, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of various screening methods compared with a pure-tone audiogram for detection of hearing impairment in older adults. Six good-quality studies directly compared the accuracy of screening methods for hearing impairment in older adults.Studies used different thresholds and criteria to define hearing impairment, which makes comparison of methods somewhat challenging, but evidence is consistent that common screening tests are useful in identifying persons at increased risk for hearing loss. Simple screening methods, such as the whispered voice test and single-question screening, seem to be nearly as accurate for detecting hearing loss as more detailed questionnaires or handheld audiometers. Negative findings on handheld audiometers may be particularly helpful in ruling out hearing loss greater than 40 dB.Median positive likelihood ratios (LRs) among the screening tests at greater than 25 or 30 dB were in the range of 3.0 to 5.1 for single-question screening, HHIE-S, and whispered voice test at 2 feet (in ascending order). Negative LRs ranged from 0.03 to 0.52 for whispered voice test, single-question screening, and HHIE-S. The median positive LR at greater than 40 dB for the AudioScope audiometer (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, New York) was 5.8 (range, 1.7 to 4.9), and the median negative LR was 0.05 (range, 0.03 to 0.08). Finger rub and watch tick tests had substantially stronger positive LRs (10 and 70, respectively) compared with other screening methods, but they were only evaluated in a single study and the CIs were very wide (2.6 to 43 and 4.4 to 1120, respectively). Negative LRs for the finger rub and watch tick tests were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.84) and 0.57 (CI, 0.46 to 0.66), respectively.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nDirect evidence of the effect of screening for hearing loss on clinical outcomes is limited. Only 1 fair-quality randomized, controlled trial examined the effect of screening on hearing aid use. The SAI-WHAT (Screening for Auditory Impairment&ndash;Which Hearing Assessment Test) trial&nbsp;randomly assigned 2305 predominately male veterans aged 50 years or older to hearing-loss screening with a tone-emitting otoscope (AudioScope), the HHIE-S questionnaire, or combined testing versus a control group of no screening. The primary outcome was hearing aid use 1 year after screening. The mean age of participants was 61 years, and three fourths reported self-perceived hearing loss at baseline. A total of 18.6% of participants in the AudioScope group, 59.2% in the HHIE-S group, and 63.6% in the combined method group had positive screening tests. Persons in any screening group were more likely to wear hearing aids 1 year after screening than were control participants: hearing aid use was 6.3% in the AudioScope group, 4.1% in the HHIE-S group, and 7.4% in the combined group versus 3.3% in control participants (P = 0.003 for test of equality across all 4 groups). Post hoc analysis showed that hearing aid use was more common among participants reporting self-perceived hearing loss, but regardless of screening status hearing aid use was very low among those without perceived hearing impairment at baseline (0% to 1.6%). A secondary outcome of the trial was the effect of hearing aid use on quality of life, as measured by the Inner Effectiveness of Aural Rehabilitation scale. No statistically significant differences in scores were seen across the study groups after 1 year; however, the trial was powered to detect differences in hearing aid use rather than hearing-related function, so this finding does not definitively rule out a potential beneficial effect. The generalizability of these results is limited because the study comprised relatively younger male veterans with a high prevalence of perceived hearing loss who were eligible for free treatment services.A good-quality trial&nbsp;randomly assigned 194 male veterans (mean age, 72 years) with screen-detected (two thirds of participants) or previously established (one third of participants) hearing loss to immediate receipt of a free hearing aid or a wait-list control group. Screening was done with the AudioScope when it was part of the eligibility assessment, and a positive result was defined as hearing impairment of greater than 40 dB in the better ear, with confirmation by a pure-tone audiogram. The outcome of interest was quality-of-life improvements, including social, affective, cognitive, and physical domains, at 4 months as measured by a battery of self-administered instruments, including the HHIE, Quantified Denver Scale of Communicative Function (QDS), Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Self-Evaluation of Life Function. At study entry, 63% of participants reported having severe effects on hearing-related social and emotional quality of life and functioning (as defined by an HHIE score of &ge;42); the mean HHIE score for all participants was 50. Moderate communication difficulty was reported by 85% of participants (as defined by a QDS score of &gt;30). At the 4-month follow-up, HHIE and QDS scores were unchanged in the control group, but in the group that received hearing aids mean HHIE scores improved from 49 to 15 and mean QDS scores improved from 59 to 36. Mean between-group differences in HHIE and QDS scores at 4 months were 34 and 24, respectively. A follow-up study found that improvements in HHIE and QDS scores in the intervention group persisted at 12 months. Changes in Geriatric Depression Scale and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire scores differed significantly between the hearing aid and control groups, but the absolute effects were very small (&lt;1-point difference), and baseline scores did not indicate substantial levels of depression or cognitive dysfunction in this population. The trial&rsquo;s source population of white male veterans, high prevalence of moderate to severe hearing loss at study entry, and inclusion of a relatively large proportion of participants with established (rather than screen-detected) hearing impairment restricts the generalizability of these findings.The USPSTF also reviewed 2 fair-quality trials and 1 poor-quality trial of treatment of hearing loss with hearing aids. One trial found no clear difference between an assistive listening device and no treatment on changes in mean baseline scores on the HHIE-S, Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, or Revised QDS in veterans who were ineligible for free hearing aids. Another trial found no difference between a hearing aid, assistive listening device, or both and no amplification in mean scores on the HHIE-S, Brief Symptom Inventory, Activity Scale, Life Satisfaction in the Elderly Scale, or Affect Balance Scale in a subset of patients who had mild baseline hearing loss and were not using hearing aids at enrollment. The third trial did not report outcomes with sufficient detail for reliable interpretation.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo randomized trials or controlled observational studies evaluated potential adverse effects associated with screening or treating hearing impairment using hearing aids. In community-based and primary care settings, rates of false-positive tests (using &gt;25 dB as a threshold for a positive screen) ranged from 5% to 41%, depending on the test and the population. Screening could also potentially be associated with anxiety, labeling and stigma, or other psychosocial effects, but no studies were available to estimate these outcomes. According to case reports, treatment with hearing aids may be associated with cerumen impaction, dermatitis, accidental retention of molds, otitis externa, and associated middle ear problems. Because screening and confirmatory testing for hearing impairment are noninvasive and serious harms of treatment are rare, there are probably little to no adverse effects of screening for hearing loss.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nA fair-quality randomized trial that directly evaluated the effect of screening for hearing impairment showed a statistically significant increase in the use of hearing aids among screened groups after 1 year; however, no conclusions could be drawn about the effect of screening on health outcomes, such as improved quality of life and ability to function. One good-quality randomized trial of treatment showed that hearing aids can improve communication ability and social function for some older adults with known hearing impairment. In both trials, however, the study population was essentially limited to white male veterans with self-perceived or established moderate to severe hearing loss; as such, the applicability of the findings to a broader asymptomatic population is unclear. Furthermore, adherence to hearing aid use among participants diagnosed with hearing impairment in the SAI-WHAT trial was low, particularly among those who did not report self-perceived hearing loss at baseline. Although studies have consistently demonstrated that various screening tests (including clinical examinations, single- or multiple-item questionnaires, and handheld audiometers) can successfully identify persons with objective hearing loss, it is less clear how to recognize persons who will adhere to&mdash;and thus benefit from&mdash;treatment. The incremental value of screening and diagnosing asymptomatic older adults with hearing impairment in advance of presentation with symptoms is therefore unclear.Given unknown efficacy in a general, asymptomatic population, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for hearing loss in older adults.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nAlthough sensorineural hearing loss is a relatively common consequence of aging, onset of presbycusis is gradual, so many older adults may not recognize that they have an impairment or may not perceive their sensory deficits to be a problem. Some persons may simply alter their daily activities to adapt to the loss. In addition, some older adults may resist seeking treatment of hearing impairment or adhering to use of a hearing aid because of fear of social stigma or loss of independence. Limited evidence suggests that, when used, hearing aids can improve quality of life and ability to function in selected populations with moderate to severe hearing loss; sustained hearing aid use seems to be most closely associated with self-perceived hearing impairment or a greater magnitude of hearing loss. Without additional study, the relative value and likelihood of success of detecting and treating hearing loss in persons who are not aware of a problem before screening or have not sought care for perceived hearing loss are unclear.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 4 October to 11 November 2011 and again from 30 November to 13 December 2011. In response to the comments, the USPSTF has clarified its interest in health and functional outcomes related to screening and treatment of hearing loss and added language to emphasize that some persons with moderate to severe hearing loss have shown improvements in quality of life with hearing aid use. It also clarified the patient population to which the recommendation applies.Several commenters asked the USPSTF to consider data about the effect of hearing loss on social functioning of affected persons, their partners and families, and employment issues. Commenters were concerned about hearing loss being potentially misinterpreted by clinicians or caregivers as cognitive impairment. The USPSTF was also asked to consider potential benefits of incidental detection of other health conditions (for example, acoustic neuromas or multiple sclerosis) or prevention of ongoing hearing deterioration. Although the USPSTF agrees that these are important issues surrounding hearing loss, available evidence does not permit conclusions to be drawn about the actual effect of screening on any of these factors. Beneficial effects of hearing conservation measures should be detectable through the broader evaluation of hearing outcomes over time.Several commenters asked the USPSTF to consider whether an alternative recommendation should be offered for higher-risk groups. The USPSTF has specified populations that are at higher risk for hearing loss in the recommendation statement; however, the net benefit of screening in these groups and whether it differs from the general population are unknown.Finally, commenters asked for direction from the USPSTF on standardizing screening approaches in clinical practice. Given the underlying uncertainty about the net benefit of screening, it is presently difficult to provide evidence-based guidance on optimum screening approaches. Currently, no single standard of care seems to exist. Therefore, additional research is needed to clarify the ultimate effect of screening and treatment of hearing loss and to better define best practices to maximize potential for benefit.\r\n<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2>\r\nThis recommendation replaces the 1996 recommendation, in which the USPSTF recommended periodically questioning older adults about their hearing, counseling them about the availability of hearing aids, and making referrals when appropriate. This conclusion was based on the best available evidence at that time, which was indirect in nature and largely limited to studies of diagnostic accuracy and treatment of persons with established or perceived hearing loss. The previous USPSTF noted that no controlled trials could prove the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic older adults for hearing impairment. Screening and diagnostic evaluation are 2 distinct activities, and treatments may vary in effectiveness depending on how the condition is identified. There may be important differences between a person who has subjective hearing symptoms and is diagnosed with objective impairment as a result of symptoms and a person without self-perceived hearing difficulties who has a routine and automatic screening examination that detects a personally inapparent but objectively identifiable decline in hearing function. Since the 1996 recommendation was published, direct evidence from a randomized, controlled trial evaluating the effect of screening itself, rather than treatment alone, has become available. Although this trial found that screening was associated with an increase in hearing aid use, the benefit seemed to be limited to persons who had self-perceived loss of hearing at baseline<em>&mdash;</em>no difference in use was seen for asymptomatic persons with objective hearing loss detected with screening. Of note, screening was not found to have a discernible effect on hearing-related quality of life; however, the trial was not primarily designed nor did it have sufficient statistical power to detect health or functional outcomes, so additional research would be helpful to draw more definitive conclusions. Therefore, the USPSTF now concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for hearing loss in asymptomatic adults aged 50 years or older. <a name=\"recommendations\"></a>\r\n<h2>Recommendations of Other Groups</h2>\r\nThe American Speech-Language-Hearing Association recommends that adults be screened once per decade and every 3 years after age 50 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that female patients aged 13 years or older be evaluated and counseled on hearing as part of the periodic health assessment. The American Academy of Family Physicians is in the process of updating its recommendation.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Open-angle glaucoma affects approximately 2.5 million Americans and is a leading cause of impaired visual function (loss of peripheral vision) and blindness.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of screening for POAG in adults. Evidence is limited by the lack of an established gold standard against which individual screening tests can be compared.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the benefits of screening.The USPSTF found convincing evidence that treatment of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and early glaucoma reduces the number of persons who develop small, clinically unnoticeable visual field defects and that treatment of early asymptomatic POAG decreases the number of persons whose visual field defects worsen.However, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for or treatment of increased IOP or early asymptomatic POAG reduces the number of persons who will develop impaired vision or quality of life.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening. It found convincing evidence that treatment results in numerous harms, including local eye irritation from medications and risk for complications from surgery, such as early formation of cataracts. The magnitude of these harms for most persons is small. Screening is associated with a risk for false-positive and false-negative results, but the magnitude of this risk is unknown, given the considerable variability in reported test sensitivity and specificity. Screening and treatment are associated with risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment because some evidence shows that many persons with increased IOP or early POAG have an indolent long-term course yet still receive treatment.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence of effectiveness of screening for glaucoma on clinical outcomes is lacking and that the balance of benefits and harms therefore cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adults who do not have vision symptoms who are seen in a primary care setting.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nIncreased IOP, family history of glaucoma, older age, and African American race increase a person's risk for open-angle glaucoma. Recent evidence shows that glaucoma may be increased in Hispanics. Older African Americans have a higher prevalence of glaucoma and perhaps a more rapid disease progression; if screening reduces vision impairment, then African Americans would probably have greater absolute benefit than whites.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nDiagnosis of POAG is based on a combination of tests showing characteristic degenerative changes in the optic disc and defects in visual fields (often loss in peripheral vision). Although increased IOP was previously considered an important part of the definition of this condition, it is now known that many persons with POAG do not have increased IOP and not all persons with increased IOP have or will develop glaucoma. Therefore, screening with tonometry alone may be inadequate to detect all cases of POAG.Measurement of visual fields can be difficult. The reliability of a single measurement may be low; several consistent measurements are needed to establish the presence of defects. Specialists use dilated ophthalmoscopy or slit lamp examination to evaluate changes in the optic disc; however, even experts have varying ability to detect glaucomatous progression of the optic disc. In addition, no single standard exists to define and measure progression of visual field defects. Most tests that are available in a primary care setting do not have acceptable accuracy to detect glaucoma.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nThe initial aim and efficacy assessment of primary treatments of POAG are reduction of IOP. Treatments include medication, laser therapy, and surgery. These treatments also effectively reduce the longer-term development and progression of small visual field defects as assessed by clinical examination. However, the magnitude of the effectiveness in reducing impairments in patient-reported, vision-related function, including development of blindness, is uncertain.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nApproximately 2.5 million persons in the United States have glaucoma, and approximately 1.9% of adults older than 40 years have open-angle glaucoma. Most persons with glaucoma have POAG. This condition is defined as optic neuropathy with a visibly open anterior chamber angle (between the iris and the anterior sclera or peripheral cornea) that is associated with progressive death of retinal ganglion cells and axons and visual field loss.The goal of screening programs is to identify and treat POAG before visual impairment develops. The proportion of persons who are currently unidentified and who will develop vision problems as a result of a diagnosis obtained through screening is not known. The natural history of glaucoma is heterogeneous and poorly defined.In some persons, POAG does not progress or progression is so slow that it never has an important effect on vision. The size of this subgroup is uncertain and may depend on the ethnicity and age of the population and initial findings of ophthalmologic testing. Screening in asymptomatic persons is likely to increase the size of this subgroup. Other patients have more rapid progression, as determined by optic nerve damage, visual field defects, and development of visual impairment.Whether early glaucoma will progress to visual impairment cannot be precisely predicted. Whether the rate of progression of visual field defects remains uniform throughout the course of glaucoma is also not known. Older adults and African Americans seem to be at increased risk and have more rapid progression. Persons with a short life expectancy probably have little to gain from glaucoma screening.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nHarms caused by treatment of glaucoma include formation of cataracts and those resulting from surgery and from topical medications. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are possible because not all persons who are diagnosed with and treated for glaucoma progress to visual impairment; the magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is unknown.\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\nThe cost of screening varies widely depending on the tests used. Testing with hand-held tonometers and ophthalmoscopes can be done quickly and inexpensively. However, the diagnostic accuracy of these inexpensive tests is not known. According to the National Business Group on Health, the average screening eye examination costs $71. Screening with specialized tests for glaucoma and with newer computerized instruments is more expensive.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nApproximately 62% of Medicare patients enrolled in an HMO were screened for glaucoma in 2009. In 2008, approximately 53% of whites, 47% of African Americans, and 37% of Hispanics reported an annual eye care visit.<a name=\"otherconsid\"></a>\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nThe natural history of glaucoma, particularly the role of IOP and its relationship to optic nerve damage, visual field defects, visual impairment, and blindness, is poorly understood. More evidence is needed on the link between the intermediate glaucoma outcomes of optic nerve damage and visual field loss and the final health outcomes of visual disability and patient-reported outcomes. Evidence for screening would ideally come from a randomized, controlled trial of routine (or targeted) screening versus standard care with long-term follow-up. More studies on treatment that are of adequate duration and size to assess important clinical outcomes (such as visual impairment and vision-related quality of life), or at least greater changes in visual fields, are needed.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nGlaucoma is characterized as primary (idiopathic) or secondary (resulting from a known cause, such as trauma or inflammation) and as closed- or open-angle. Closed-angle glaucoma may present with acute symptoms, such as eye pain and blurred vision, and is considered an emergency. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most prevalent type of glaucoma in the United States and the focus of this recommendation. It is defined as optic neuropathy with a visibly open anterior chamber angle (between the iris and the anterior sclera or peripheral cornea) that is associated with progressive death of retinal ganglion cells and axons and visual field loss. In most cases, damage to the optic nerve is the result of increased pressure in the eye, also known as IOP.Approximately 2.5 million persons in the United States have glaucoma, and many are unaware that they have it. Important risk factors include older age, family history of the condition, and African American race. The overall estimated prevalence of glaucoma in the United States is 1.9%. Age-adjusted estimates are approximately 3 times higher in African Americans than in whites. A recent study reported a prevalence of 4.7% in Hispanics older than 40 years.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nTo update its 2004 recommendation on screening for glaucoma, the USPSTF reviewed evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and of medical and surgical treatment of early glaucoma. Beneficial outcomes of interest for the USPSTF included improved vision-related quality of life and reduced progression of early asymptomatic glaucoma to vision-related impairment. The USPSTF also considered evidence on the accuracy of screening tests for glaucoma.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF considered evidence on the accuracy of direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, photography and computerized imaging of the fundus, measurement of corneal thickness combined with another test for glaucoma, perimetry, and tonometry. The USPSTF did not consider evidence on tests that are experimental or no longer commonly used in the screening for or diagnosis of glaucoma.Evaluating the evidence on screening tests is complicated by the lack of an established standard for the diagnosis of glaucoma and a consequent lack of an established gold standard to evaluate accuracy. The USPSTF reviewed more than 100 studies on the accuracy of various tests for glaucoma. Instead of an established gold standard, many investigators used confirmation of POAG at follow-up examination, diagnosis of POAG requiring treatment, and other individual tests or combinations of tests as the reference against which to evaluate accuracy.Tests with the most published studies on accuracy include optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, confocal scanning laser tomography, frequency-doubling technology, and the Humphrey visual field analyzer. Studies varied appreciably in the devices, variables, thresholds for diagnosis, and measurement of outcomes used. Many studies had several methodological limitations, including enrollment of participants who were not representative of persons who would be tested in practice.Most studies did not blind personnel who interpreted test results to the findings of the reference standard and vice versa. Many studies used a reference test that included 1 or more tests comprising the candidate test, resulting in a significant concern about bias. Because of the methodological limitations, variability in study designs, and lack of a diagnostic standard, the USPSTF was not able to make conclusions about the overall accuracy of screening for glaucoma.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo studies directly evaluated whether screening prevents visual field loss, visual impairment, or worsening quality of life. Whereas evidence shows that medical and surgical treatment of early asymptomatic POAG reduce the number of patients whose visual field defects progress, no studies evaluated whether they reduce progression to visual impairment or improve quality of life.The USPSTF assessed 1 systematic review (of 10 studies) and 19 additional randomized, controlled trials that evaluated whether medical treatment slows the progression of visual field loss. A systematic review of 10 studies published in 2007 concluded that medical treatment had a significant protective effect on incident worsening of visual field measurements compared with placebo or no treatment (odds ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.81]). Nineteen additional primary studies reported mixed results with treatment; a few reported improvements in visual field measurements with medical treatment, 7 reported no change, and 9 reported worsening of visual field measurements.Most of these studies were not large or long enough to detect differences in the rates of visual field loss or clinically relevant outcomes related to glaucoma, given the slowly progressive nature of the disease. Three large studies of long duration reported mixed results; 2 studies concluded that medical treatment reduced glaucoma progression, and 1 found no difference between medical treatment and placebo. A 2005 systematic review of 5 randomized, controlled trials that assigned participants to medical and/or surgical treatment or to no treatment reported that those receiving medical and/or surgical treatment were less likely to have progression of visual field loss and optic disc damage (hazard ratio for topical medications vs. no treatment, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.81]).\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening or Treatment</h3>\r\nNo studies addressed the harms of screening. Several assessed the harms of treatment. Eye redness was the most commonly reported adverse effect of topical medical treatments for glaucoma. In observational studies, the percentage of patients reporting eye redness ranged from 2% to 21%, depending on dose, length of use, and type of medication. Eye pain and burning were also commonly reported with topical medications, occurring in 1% to 3% of participants in observational studies. Other reported adverse effects of topical medications included eye irritation, eye dryness, increased iris pigmentation, and cystoid macular edema.Surgical treatments of glaucoma were associated with hypotony, hyphema, shallow anterior chambers, cataract, and choroidal detachment. Penetrating surgical interventions (trabeculectomy) were associated with more frequent adverse effects than nonpenetrating procedures. Studies of surgical procedures more commonly reported cataracts, infection, bleeding, and synechiae than did studies of medications.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nEvidence on the accuracy of screening tests and the benefits of screening or treatment in delaying or preventing visual impairment or improving quality of life is inadequate. Therefore, the overall certainty of the evidence is low, and the USPSTF is unable to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for glaucoma in asymptomatic adults.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nThe exact cause of POAG is not known. Diagnosis of glaucoma is usually based on several tests that, when combined, evaluate the biological structure and function of the optic nerve and the IOP. Persons with POAG may not have increased IOP, and increased IOP may not result in nerve damage and eventual visual impairment. This finding limits the development of a single gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of screening tests.Most persons with glaucoma do not have symptoms. Once vision loss occurs&mdash;usually slow loss of side or peripheral vision&mdash;the optic nerve is already damaged. When damage is severe enough, loss of vision impairs function and quality of life. Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness.Treatments that reduce IOP prevent the decline in the biological structure and function of the optic nerve caused by glaucoma, thus slowing the worsening of visual field loss. However, the slowly progressive nature of glaucoma makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, especially in preventing or slowing clinically noticeable loss of vision, and screening may lead to detection and treatment of many persons who will remain asymptomatic throughout their life (known as overdiagnosis and overtreatment).\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 19 February to 18 March 2013. A few comments noted that important population subgroups are at increased risk for glaucoma. The USPSTF updated the section on risk with new information on Hispanics. A few comments disagreed that there is no accepted gold standard for screening for glaucoma. None of the comments came to a consensus on an accepted standard for screening, and no change was made to the recommendation statement.  A few comments cited studies to provide evidence on the link between visual field loss and quality of life. The USPSTF reviewed these studies and determined that they did not provide the necessary evidence to change its conclusions. The USPSTF made several minor revisions to the recommendation statement in response to requests for corrections and clarifications.",

Ninety percent of all cases of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer are classified as squamous-cell carcinoma. An estimated 41,380 new cases of and 7890 deaths from cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx will occur in 2013. At the time of diagnosis, more than 50% of persons with oral and pharyngeal cancer have regional or distant metastases. Screening for oral cancer may be helpful if potentially malignant disorders can be identified earlier and treated successfully.Oral and oropharyngeal cancer have different causes. Oral cavity cancer is predominantly caused by tobacco and alcohol use. Oropharyngeal cancer, another subset of neck and head cancer, includes human papillomavirus (HPV) as an important risk factor. The incidence and mortality rate of oral cancer has been decreasing in the United States presumably because of reduced tobacco and alcohol use. However, HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer is increasing in incidence. Oropharyngeal cancer includes lesions of the tonsil, oropharynx, and base of the tongue. The epidemiology of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer is evolving and could have important implications for identifying high-risk populations that might benefit from screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that the oral screening examination accurately detects oral cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for oral cancer and treatment of screen-detected oral cancer improves morbidity or mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening.

The prevalence of oral HPV infection is associated with age, sex, number of sexual partners, and number of cigarettes smoked per day. The effect of multifactorial risk assessment and screening for risk factors on oral cancer morbidity and mortality is unknown.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe primary screening test for oral cancer is a systematic clinical examination of the oral cavity. According to the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, an oral cancer screening examination should include a visual inspection of the face, neck, lips, labial mucosa, buccal mucosa, gingiva, floor of the mouth, tongue, and palate. Mouth mirrors can help visualize all surfaces. The examination also includes palpating the regional lymph nodes, tongue, and floor of the mouth. Any abnormality that lasts for more than 2 weeks should be reevaluated and considered for biopsy. <br><br>Oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located at the base of the tongue (the back third of the tongue), the soft palate (the back part of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat. A comprehensive examination of the oropharynx may require referral to a dental provider or specialist, which is outside the scope of this recommendation.<br><br>Additional tests proposed as adjuncts to the oral cancer screening examination include toluidine blue dye staining, chemiluminescent and autofluorescent lighting devices, and brush cytopathology. These screening and adjunct tests have not been adequately tested in primary care nondental settings. Although there is interest in screening for oral HPV infection, medical and dental organizations do not recommend it. Currently, no screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Evaluating the accuracy of tests that detect oral HPV infection is a potentially promising area of research.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\nThis recommendation is intended for primary care providers and does not pertain to dental providers or otolaryngologists. Dental care providers and otolaryngologists may conduct a comprehensive examination of the oral cavity and pharynx during the clinical encounter. In deciding whether to screen for oral cancer, primary care providers should consider the following factors. <br><br><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em> <br><br>Up to 75% of cases of oral cancer may be attributed to tobacco and alcohol use. Since 1979, the incidence rate of oral cavity cancer in the United States has been decreasing because of the reduced consumption of alcohol and smoking prevalence. <br><br>During this period, the incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma has increased. Cancer registry data have shown that from 1988 to 2004, HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer has decreased from 2.0 cases to 1.0 case per 100,000 persons and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer has increased more than 3-fold from 0.8 case to 2.6 cases per 100,000 persons. The overall prevalence of oral HPV infection is estimated to be 6.9% in adults aged 14 to 69 years in the United States. However, HPV prevalence can be as high as 20% for persons who have more than 20 lifetime sexual partners or currently use tobacco (more than 1 pack of cigarettes per day). <br><br>The prevalence of type-specific HPV-16 oral infection is estimated at 1% in adults aged 14 to 69 years (an estimated 2.13 million infected persons). Human papillomavirus-16 is associated with approximately 85% to 95% of cases of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Therefore, the increasing role of oral HPV infection as a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer may warrant future assessment of the independent effect of HPV-16 on incidence and outcomes of oropharyngeal cancer and the health effect of screening persons who are HPV-16&ndash;positive. <br><br><em>Potential Harms</em> <br><br>Suspected oral cancer or its precursors (such as erythroplakia, due to its high risk for transformation to cancer) detected through examination require confirmation by tissue biopsy, which may lead to harms. Harms of treatment of screen-detected oral cancer and its potential precursors (leukoplakia and erythroplakia) may result from complications of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The natural history of screen-detected oral cancer is not well-understood, and as a result, the harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment are unknown. <br><br><em>Current Practice<br><br></em>In a 2008 survey of U.S. adults, 29.4% of those aged 18 years or older reported ever having an oral cancer examination in which a physician, dentist, or other health professional pulled on their tongue or palpated their neck. It is unknown what percentage of these examinations were conducted by dentists rather than physicians or other health professionals. Adults aged 40 years or older are more likely to have ever had an examination than those aged 18 to 39 years, despite smoking status. Adults who are most at risk for oral cancer (current smokers aged &ge;40 years) are less likely to have ever had an oral cancer examination than former smokers or adults who have never smoked.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen all adults for tobacco use, recommend against tobacco use, and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. The USPSTF also recommends screening and behavioral counseling interventions in primary care settings to reduce alcohol misuse by adults.\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nOne of the most important research needs is a randomized, controlled trial assessing the benefits and harms of oral cancer screening in U.S. persons who are at increased risk, such as those with a history of tobacco and heavy alcohol use. Continued research is needed to determine the accuracy of primary care providers, dental hygienists, dentists, or other trained persons screening U.S. patients who are at increased risk. Also needed is longitudinal follow-up of screening studies applicable to the United States that will show the health effect of screening for oral cancer and a clear understanding of who is at high risk in the United States. In addition, given the higher risks for death from oral cancer among African Americans and men, more research is warranted about the risks and benefits of screening in these populations. <br><br>If HPV continues to become a more clinically significant risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer, the benefits of screening for HPV and selection of populations for oral cancer screening based on HPV status will need to be assessed. As the epidemiology evolves, the most effective screening examination will need to be determined. No screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the FDA. More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of screening for oropharyngeal cancer. Other areas of research include learning about the natural history of oral HPV infection. <br><br>Vaccines that reduce the risk for HPV infection are available. Whether current vaccines can prevent infection at noncervical sites and help reduce the risk for oropharyngeal cancer is unknown. Research is needed to assess the efficacy of HPV vaccines in preventing infection at noncervical sites and in decreasing the risk for oropharyngeal cancer.",

The American Cancer Society recommends that adults aged 20 years or older who have periodic health examinations should have the oral cavity examined as part of a cancer-related checkup. The American Dental Association recommends that providers remain alert for signs of potentially malignant lesions or early-stage cancer in patients during routine oral examinations, particularly for patients who use tobacco or have heavy alcohol consumption.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nAccording to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Cancer Institute, there were 35,807 cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer in the United States in 2009, the most recent year of data available. Nearly three fourths of all cases occur in men, making it the eighth most common cancer in men (it is the 14th most common cancer in women) in the United States.<br><br>More than one half of all persons with oral and pharyngeal cancer have regional or distant metastases at diagnosis. Relative 5-year survival is 82.4% for localized disease, 55.5% for regional lymph node spread, and 33.2% for distant metastases. Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer are diagnosed an average 5 years younger and have better survival than patients with HPV-negative oral cancer. <br><br>African Americans previously had higher incidence rates of oral and pharyngeal cancer than white persons. However, current data indicate a change in racial or ethnic incidence rates, such that white men and women now have higher incidence rates. This change in incidence is ascribed to increases in HPV-related oral and pharyngeal (including oropharyngeal) cancer in white persons, along with a reduction in HPV-related and non&ndash;HPV-related oral and pharyngeal cancer in African Americans. American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, and Latino men and women have lower incidence rates than white and African American men and women. Mortality rates are substantially higher in African Americans and in men; mortality rates in American Indian and Alaska Native men are about the same as in white men, but Asian, Pacific Islander, and Latino men have lower mortality rates than white men.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe previous USPSTF recommendation found no evidence that screening for oral cancer led to improved health outcomes and no evidence on the harms of screening or the benefits of early treatment. To update its previous recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence to answer the following questions: 1) Does screening for oral cancer reduce morbidity or mortality? and 2) How accurate is the screening oral examination for identifying oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders that have a high likelihood of progression to oral cancer? The focus of this recommendation is screening (visual inspection and palpation) of the oral cavity performed by primary care providers and not dental providers or otolaryngologists.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nNo evidence was found on screening for oral cancer in the general or high-risk U.S. population. Seven studies (<em>n</em> = 49,120) examined the performance characteristics of the oral screening examination. These studies were generally conducted in settings with an increased incidence of and mortality rate from oral cancer (India and Taiwan) compared with U.S. rates. The studies also had considerable heterogeneity in who performed the screening and greatly varied in test performance characteristics. <br><br>Across the 7 studies, sensitivity for oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders ranged from 18.0% to 94.3% and specificity ranged from 54.0% to 99.9%. The positive predictive value ranged from 17.0% to 86.6%, and the negative predictive value ranged from 73.0% to 99.3%. <br><br>Two studies in the United Kingdom assessed oral examinations performed by general dentists in older adults (aged &ge;40 years) who were at increased risk because of alcohol and tobacco use and in a mixed sample with unknown risk factors. The dental examination in the high-risk sample (<em>n</em>= 2027) showed a sensitivity of 74%, specificity of 99%, and positive predictive value of 67%, whereas the study of patients with unknown risk factors found a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 99%, and positive predictive value of 86%. Although the patients in the U.K. study may be similar to those in the U.S. population, the results of these studies are limited by an imperfect reference standard (comparison with a &ldquo;more expert&rdquo; examiner), by combining the detection of potentially malignant disorders with that of oral cancer, and by an unclear delineation of high-risk status. These results would need to be confirmed by studies with longitudinal follow-up.<br><br>When compared with expert or trained screening examinations, self-examinations in 2 studies performed in India and the United Kingdom were insensitive (18% and 33%, respectively). Toluidine blue was not found to significantly improve screening for premalignant or malignant lesions, did not affect the incidence of oral cancer, and did not improve outcomes (1 study). No acceptable evidence for other adjunctive devices was found in the literature.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo direct evidence was available on whether screening reduces morbidity or mortality in general or high-risk U.S. populations. One fair-quality, randomized, controlled trial of home-based screening for oral cancer by advanced health workers (<em>n</em> = 191,873) conducted in Kerala, India, found no statistical difference in oral cancer mortality rates between screening and control groups after 9 years of follow-up (rate ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.22]). After an additional screening round and 15 years of follow-up, oral cancer mortality ratios were of similar magnitude and not statistically significant. Screened participants were diagnosed with oral cancer at earlier stages with a greater 5-year survival than control participants, possibly as a result of lead-time bias. <br><br>A post hoc subgroup analysis of participants in the Kerala study who reported tobacco and alcohol use (<em>n</em>= 84,600) found a significant reduction in oral cancer mortality rates in those assigned to the screening group (rate ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.45 to 0.95]). A similar post hoc analysis at 15 years suggested a diminished but still significant oral cancer mortality reduction in the screening group (rate ratio, 0.76 [CI, 0.60 to 0.97]). However, the subgroup analyses do not meet high-quality criteria. The results of the overall study and the post hoc subgroup analysis do not provide sufficient evidence on screening because of limited applicability to the U.S. population and methodological limitations, such as inadequate accounting for clustering in the results, low adherence to follow-up, imbalance in baseline risk factors, possible lead- and length-time bias, and not reporting harms of screening or how lesions were treated. In addition, these participants commonly chewed paan (a carcinogenic compound containing areca nut and betel leaf), which is not used in the United States and affects the generalizability of this study. India also has higher oral cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality, as well as a different health care system, than the United States, which also affects the applicability of the study results in the U.S. population.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nA potentially important harm of screening for oral cancer is adverse effects from biopsy or surgery performed on oral lesions that would have regressed spontaneously or not have progressed to cancer during a patient's lifetime (overdiagnosis and overtreatment). There was insufficient evidence on harms from the screening test or from false-positive or false-negative results.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy, benefits, and harms of screening for oral cancer. Therefore, the USPSTF was unable to determine the balance of benefits and harms.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nThe oral cancer examination is designed to detect oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders at earlier stages. However, visual examination or biopsy cannot reliably distinguish potentially malignant disorders from lesions that may spontaneously regress or not progress (overdiagnosis), and evidence that earlier treatment improves health outcomes is lacking. Test performance characteristics for the oral screening examinations also varied widely.<br><br>The natural history of oropharyngeal cancer is not well-understood. Knowledge of this particular cancer is evolving as more is learned about the association between oropharyngeal cancer and HPV. More evidence is needed to address effective screening strategies, treatment, and primary prevention. Clinical outcomes may differ among countries based on predominant etiology because patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer are generally diagnosed younger and survive longer than patients with HPV-negative oral cancer.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 9 April to 6 May 2013. In response to these comments, the USPSTF added additional language to the Rationale, Clinical Considerations, and Discussion sections to emphasize that the recommendation statement applies to primary care providers and not dental providers. Additional language was added throughout the recommendation statement to further define oral cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. Language addressing HPV vaccination and screening tools was added to the Research Needs and Gaps section. Clarifying language about adjunct screening tools was added to the Accuracy of Screening Tests section. Additional language was also added to describe the oral cavity examination in the Clinical Considerations section.\r\n<h2>Update of the Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2>\r\nIn 2004, the USPSTF issued an I statement for screening for oral cancer because it found no evidence that screening for oral cancer led to improved health outcomes and no evidence on the harms of screening or the benefits of early treatment. <br><br>In the current recommendation, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence that the oral screening examination accurately detects oral cancer. It also found inadequate evidence that screening for oral cancer and treatment of screen-detected oral cancer improves morbidity or mortality. The evidence for screening for oral cancer remains insufficient; therefore, the USPSTF is unable to make a recommendation in favor of or against screening (I statement).",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The most important risk factor for lung cancer is smoking, which results in approximately 85% of all U.S. lung cancer cases. Although the prevalence of smoking has decreased, approximately 37% of U.S. adults are current or former smokers. The incidence of lung cancer increases with age and occurs most commonly in persons aged 55 years or older. Increasing age and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke are the 2 most common risk factors for lung cancer.&nbsp;Lung cancer has a poor prognosis, and nearly 90% of persons with lung cancer die of the disease. However, early-stage non&ndash;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a better prognosis and can be treated with surgical resection.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>Most lung cancer cases are NSCLC, and most screening programs focus on the detection and treatment of early-stage NSCLC. Although chest radiography and sputum cytologic evaluation have been used to screen for lung cancer, LDCT has greater sensitivity for detecting early-stage cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Although lung cancer screening is not an alternative to smoking cessation, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in a defined population of high-risk persons can prevent a substantial number of lung cancer&ndash;related deaths. Direct evidence from a large, well-conducted, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) provides moderate certainty of the benefit of lung cancer screening with LDCT in this population. The magnitude of benefit to the person depends on that person's risk for lung cancer because those who are at highest risk are most likely to benefit. Screening cannot prevent most lung cancer&ndash;related deaths, and smoking cessation remains essential.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The harms associated with LDCT screening include false-negative and false-positive results, incidental findings, overdiagnosis, and radiation exposure. False-positive LDCT results occur in a substantial proportion of screened persons; 95% of all positive results do not lead to a diagnosis of cancer. In a high-quality screening program, further imaging can resolve most false-positive results; however, some patients may require invasive procedures.&nbsp;The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on the harms associated with incidental findings. Overdiagnosis of lung cancer occurs, but its precise magnitude is uncertain. A modeling study performed for the USPSTF estimated that 10% to 12% of screen-detected cancer cases are overdiagnosed&mdash;that is, they would not have been detected in the patient's lifetime without screening. Radiation harms, including cancer resulting from cumulative exposure to radiation, vary depending on the age at the start of screening; the number of scans received; and the person's exposure to other sources of radiation, particularly other medical imaging.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT is of moderate net benefit in asymptomatic persons who are at high risk for lung cancer based on age, total cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke, and years since quitting smoking. The moderate net benefit of screening depends on limiting screening to persons who are at high risk, the accuracy of image interpretation being similar to that found in the NLST (National Lung Screening Trial), and the resolution of most false-positive results without invasive procedures.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThe risk for lung cancer increases with age and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke and decreases with time since quitting smoking. The best evidence for the benefit of screening comes from the NLST, which enrolled adults aged 55 to 74 years who had at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years. As with all screening trials, the NLST tested a specific intervention over a finite period. Because initial eligibility extended through age 74 years and participants received 3 annual screening computed tomographic scans, the oldest participants in the trial were aged 77 years. <br><br>The USPSTF used modeling studies to predict the benefits and harms of screening programs that use different screening intervals, age ranges, smoking histories, and times since quitting. A program that annually screens adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years is projected to have a reasonable balance of benefits and harms. The model assumes that persons who achieve 15 years of smoking cessation during the screening program discontinue screening. This model predicts the outcomes of continuing the screening program used in the NLST through age 80 years. <br><br>Screening may not be appropriate for patients with substantial comorbid conditions, particularly those who are in the upper end of the screening age range. The NLST excluded persons who were unlikely to complete curative lung cancer surgery and those with medical conditions that posed a substantial risk for death during the 8-year trial. The baseline characteristics of the NLST showed a relatively healthy sample, and fewer than 10% of enrolled participants were older than 70 years. Persons with serious comorbid conditions may experience net harm, no net benefit, or at least substantially less net benefit. Similarly, persons who are unwilling to have curative lung surgery are unlikely to benefit from a screening program.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nAge, total exposure to tobacco smoke, and years since quitting smoking are important risk factors for lung cancer and were used to determine eligibility in the NLST. Other risk factors include specific occupational exposures, radon exposure, family history, and history of pulmonary fibrosis or chronic obstructive lung disease. The incidence of lung cancer is relatively low in persons younger than 50 years but increases with age, especially after age 60 years. In current and former smokers, age-specific incidence rates increase with age and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke.<br><br>Smoking cessation substantially reduces a person's risk for developing and dying of lung cancer. Among persons enrolled in the NLST, those who were at highest risk because of additional risk factors or a greater cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke experienced most of the benefit. A validated multivariate model showed that persons in the highest 60% of risk accounted for 88% of all deaths preventable by screening.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nLow-dose computed tomography has shown high sensitivity and acceptable specificity for the detection of lung cancer in high-risk persons. Chest radiography and sputum cytologic evaluation have not shown adequate sensitivity or specificity as screening tests. Therefore, LDCT is currently the only recommended screening test for lung cancer.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nSurgical resection is the current standard of care for localized NSCLC. This type of cancer is treated with surgical resection when possible and also with radiation and chemotherapy. Annual LDCT screening may not be useful for patients with life-limiting comorbid conditions or poor functional status who may not be candidates for surgery.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nSmoking cessation is the most important intervention to prevent NSCLC. Advising smokers to stop smoking and preventing nonsmokers from being exposed to tobacco smoke are the most effective ways to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with lung cancer. Current smokers should be informed of their continuing risk for lung cancer and offered cessation treatments. Screening with LDCT should be viewed as an adjunct to tobacco cessation interventions.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nClinicians have many resources to help patients stop smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a Web site with many such resources, including information on tobacco quit lines, available in several languages (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips\">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips</a>). Quit lines provide telephone-based behavioral counseling and support to tobacco users who want to quit smoking. Counseling is provided by trained cessation specialists who follow standardized protocols that may include several sessions and are generally provided at no cost to users. The content has been adapted for specific populations and can be tailored for individual clients. Strong evidence shows that quit lines can expand the use of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments in populations that may have limited access to treatment options. <br><br>Combination therapy with counseling and medications is more effective at increasing cessation rates than either component alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several forms of nicotine replacement therapy (gum, lozenge, transdermal patch, inhaler, and nasal spray), as well as bupropion and varenicline. More information on the treatment of tobacco dependence can be found in the U.S. Public Health Service Reference Guide &ldquo;Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update&rdquo; (available at <a href=\"http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/clinicians/reference/tobaqrg.pdf\">www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/clinicians/reference/tobaqrg.pdf</a>). The National Cancer Institute has developed a patient and physician guide for shared decision making for lung cancer screening based on the NLST (available at <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians\">www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians</a>). This 1-page resource may be a useful communication tool for providers and patients. <br><br>In addition, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has developed guidelines for the follow-up of lung nodules. The appropriate follow-up and management of abnormalities found on LDCT scans are important given the high rates of false-positive results and the potential for harms. Lung cancer screening with LDCT should be implemented as part of a program of care, as outlined in the next section.",

      "other": "In 2012, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the American Thoracic Society recommended screening for lung cancer with LDCT primarily on the basis of results from the NLST, using eligibility criteria that closely modeled those of the NLST (persons aged 55 to 74 years who have a &ge;30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years). The recommendations also stipulated that screening should be offered only in clinical settings similar to those in the trial. <br><br>The American Association for Thoracic Surgery&nbsp;recommends annual screening with LDCT in current and former smokers aged 55 to 79 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history. It also recommends annual screening starting at age 50 to 79 years in patients who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and additional comorbid conditions that produce a cumulative risk for cancer of at least 5% over the next 5 years. Furthermore, it recommends annual screening in long-term cancer survivors aged 55 to 79 years. <br><br>In 2013, the American Cancer Society&nbsp;also began recommending screening for lung cancer with LDCT in high-risk patients who are in relatively good health and meet the NLST criteria (persons aged 55 to 74 years who have a &ge;30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years). It recommends against the use of chest radiography and strongly suggests that all adults who receive screening enter an organized screening program that has experience in LDCT. <br><br>In addition, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&nbsp;recommends LDCT screening in selected patients who are at high risk for lung cancer. High risk is defined as persons aged 55 to 74 years who have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and, if a former smoker, 15 years or less since quitting or persons aged 50 years or older who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and 1 additional risk factor. It does not recommend lung cancer screening in persons who are at moderate risk (aged &ge;50 years and &ge;20 pack-year smoking history or secondhand smoke exposure but no additional lung cancer risk factors) or low risk (younger than 50 years or smoking history of &lt;20 pack-years).",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nLung cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 persons are higher in men and vary according to the duration of and exposure to tobacco smoke. The most important risk factor for lung cancer is smoking, which results in approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases in the United States. Although the prevalence of smoking has decreased, approximately 37% of U.S. adults are current or former smokers. In 2008, an estimated 7 million U.S. adults aged 55 to 75 years had a 30 pack-year or more smoking history.<br><br>The incidence of lung cancer increases with age, occurring most commonly in adults aged 55 years or older. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, accounting for approximately 28% of all deaths from cancer. Death from lung cancer is often related to the initial stage of diagnosis. The average 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is among the lowest (17%) of all types of cancer but is higher when the disease is diagnosed at an early stage (52%). However, only 15% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at such a stage.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nTo update the 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to assess the efficacy of LDCT, chest radiography, and sputum cytologic evaluation for lung cancer screening in asymptomatic persons who are at average or high risk for lung cancer (current or former smokers). The review focused on new evidence from RCTs to determine the effectiveness of these screening tests in improving health outcomes. Information about the harms associated with these screening tests was obtained from RCTs and cohort studies. The benefits and harms associated with surgical resection of early-stage NSCLC were also examined. <br><br>In addition to the evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned modeling studies from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to provide information about the optimum age at which to begin and end screening, the optimum screening interval, and the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies. The modeling studies complement the evidence that the systematic review provides.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe sensitivity of chest radiography for detecting lung cancer varies depending on the size and location of the lesion, image quality of the scan, and skill of the radiologist who interprets the scan. Low-dose computed tomography has emerged as a test with higher sensitivity and specificity for lung cancer than chest radiography. In 2004, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to recommend for or against screening for lung cancer with LDCT, chest radiography, sputum cytologic evaluation, or a combination of these tests (I statement). Since then, many RCTs have been done and published, resulting in more data on the benefits and harms of screening. Recent data from the NLST showed a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 73.4% for LDCT and a sensitivity of 73.5% and specificity of 91.3% for chest radiography. Sputum cytologic evaluation is now rarely used for lung cancer screening, and no studies reported on the test characteristics of this screening method.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nFour RCTs reported the effectiveness of LDCT for lung cancer screening. The largest trial, the NLST, showed a reduction in lung cancer mortality of 16% (95% CI, 5.0% to 25.0%) and a reduction in all-cause mortality of 6.7% (95% CI, 1.2% to 13.6%). This trial included more than 50,000 asymptomatic adults aged 55 to 74 years who had at least a 30 pack-year smoking history. <br><br>Participants were current or former smokers and were randomly assigned to LDCT or chest radiography. They received annual testing at baseline and years 1 and 2 and were followed for a median of 6.5 years. After 6 to 7 years of follow-up, 2.06% of patients in the chest radiography group and 1.75% of those in the LDCT group had died of lung cancer, for an absolute difference of 0.31% and a number needed to screen of about 320. The number needed to screen is based on 3 annual screenings; screening the same sample over a longer period will result in a much lower estimate. <br><br>In contrast to the NLST, 3 small European trials showed potential harm or no benefit of screening. Two small fair-quality trials, the DANTE (Detection and Screening of Early Lung Cancer by Novel Imaging Technology and Molecular Essays) trial and the DLCST (Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial), showed no benefit associated with LDCT compared with no LDCT. However, these were smaller trials (<em>n</em> = 2472 and 4104, respectively) that may have had limited power to detect a true benefit. <br><br>Of note, the inclusion criteria in the DLCST resulted in younger and healthier participants than in other trials. The relative risk for all-cause mortality in the DLCST was 1.46 (95% CI, 0.99 to 2.15). This finding raises the possibility of potential harm of screening a young, healthy population. Follow-up in the DLCST was 4.7 years. Combined data from the DLCST and the NELSON (Dutch&ndash;Belgian Randomised Lung Cancer Screening) trial will be reported soon. When these 3 fair- or good-quality trials were combined in a meta-analysis, the relative risk for lung cancer mortality was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.91). Another European trial, the MILD (Multicentric Italian Lung Detection) study, was rated as poor quality because of concerns about the adequacy of randomization; its results were not included in the final meta-analysis. <br><br>Two fair- to good-quality trials found no benefits associated with chest radiography screening. The larger of these trials, the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial, evaluated more than 150,000 participants from the general population and found no benefits of this type of screening in this group or in a subgroup that had tobacco smoke exposure. <br><br>Smaller RCTs from Europe had different eligibility criteria and have not yet duplicated the findings of the NLST; therefore, only moderate certainty exists about the magnitude of benefit from screening. As with all screening trials, these studies were done over a limited time frame, with the NLST evaluating the effect of 3 annual screenings. Modeling is required to estimate the effect of screening beyond that evaluated in a clinical trial. Estimates of the results of different screening intervals, ages at which to start and stop screening, and thresholds for smoking history come from modeling studies that CISNET conducted for the USPSTF. <br><br>Annual screening with LDCT provides the greatest benefit in decreasing lung cancer mortality compared with biennial or triennial screening. The <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/lungcan/lungcanfinalrs.htm#tab\">Table</a> shows the results of annual screening strategies between the ages of 55 and 80 years that had a better balance of benefits and harms than other strategies in this age range. Focusing screening efforts on the highest-risk persons, those with at least a 40 pack-year smoking history, results in the lowest number of screening scans per death averted and, therefore, the least harm to patients in terms of risk for overdiagnosis and consequences of false-positive results. <br><br>Screening progressively larger proportions of the population by lowering the screening threshold increases the number of deaths averted but with a progressively higher number of screening scans per death averted, therefore increasing harm. The <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/lungcan/lungcanfinalrs.htm#tab\">Table</a> shows that increasing the proportion of the population screened from 13% to 36% increases the number of deaths averted by 75% but increases the number of screening scans by 327%, greatly increasing the probability of an untoward event after the evaluation of a false-positive result and the number of radiation-induced cancer deaths. The highlighted program&mdash;screening current or former smokers aged 55 to 80 years who have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and discontinuing (or not starting) screening after 15 years of smoking abstinence&mdash;most closely resembles the strategy applied to participants in the NLST and offers a reasonable balance of benefits and harms.<br> The CISNET modeling studies show similar life-years gained per death averted and proportion of cancer cases detected at an early stage across the screening strategies. The modeling studies estimate that 9.5% to 11.9% of screen-detected cancer cases are overdiagnosed&mdash;that is, they would not have been detected in the patient's lifetime without screening. <strong><br><br>Table.

The sensitivity of LDCT ranged from 80% to 100%, suggesting a false-negative rate of 0% to 20%. The specificity of LDCT ranged from 28% to 100%. <br><br>The positive predictive value for lung cancer of an abnormal test result ranged from 2% to 42% . As mentioned previously, the NLST is the largest trial of lung cancer screening to date, and recent results showed a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 73.4% for LDCT. In the NLST, the positive predictive value for a positive finding of a pulmonary nodule measuring 4 mm or larger was 3.8%. <br><br>Over the 3 rounds of screening in the NLST, 24.2% of screening test results were positive; 96.4% of these were false-positives. Most positive test results were followed by additional imaging. Approximately 2.5% of positive test results required additional invasive diagnostic procedures, such as bronchoscopy, needle biopsy, or thoracoscopy. Of the 17,053 positive test results evaluated, there were approximately 61 complications and 6 deaths after a diagnostic procedure. Recently published data from the first round of screening in the NLST showed an average of 1 follow-up scan per positive screening test result. Approximately 1.9% of NLST participants had a biopsy. <br><br>The most common incidental findings on LDCT were emphysema and coronary artery calcifications. Other pulmonary findings included bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, carcinoid tumors, and hamartomas. The NLST reported 7.5% clinically significant LDCT abnormalities that were not lung cancer. None of the studies reported data on the evaluations that may have occurred in response to the incidental findings. Therefore, the harms and benefits associated with incidental findings cannot currently be determined. <br><br>Overdiagnosis was not formally reported in any study. The NLST found 119 more lung cancer cases in approximately 26,000 participants in the LDCT group than in the chest radiography group after 6.5 years of follow-up, which suggests some overdiagnosis. Recent data from the Italian Continuing Observation of Smoking Subjects cohort study of approximately 5000 participants showed that of the 120 incident cancer cases, 25% were slow-growing or indolent (based on volume-doubling time), thus possibly indicating some overdiagnosis with LDCT. <br><br>Radiation exposure associated with LDCT ranged from 0.61 to 1.5 mSv per scan. To provide context, annual background radiation exposure in the United States averages 2.4 mSv, radiation exposure from mammography is 0.7 mSv, and radiation exposure from head computed tomography is 1.7 mSv. The risk for radiation-induced lung cancer depends on the age at which a person begins screening and the amount of cumulative radiation received. On the basis of modeling studies, starting annual LDCT screening before age 50 years may result in more radiation-related lung cancer deaths than starting annual screening after age 50 years. <br><br>Overall, LDCT screening did not seem to result in substantial long-term psychological distress, although assessment has been limited. No studies reported long-term differences in anxiety or distress levels associated with LDCT in participants.No RCTs compared treatment of stage IA or IB lung cancer with surgical resection versus no treatment. Surgical resection is the standard of care in the United States for early-stage NSCLC. Studies of symptomatic and unselected patients reported 5-year survival rates associated with surgical resection of 71% to 90% for stage IA cancer and 42% to 75% for stage IB cancer. <br><br>No RCTs of LDCT screening evaluated the harms associated with screen-detected cancer. Studies that reported the harms of surgical resection were done in patients who were identified in clinical practice and had comorbid conditions.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nOn the basis of data from the systematic evidence review and modeling studies, the USPSTF determined with moderate certainty that annual LDCT screening provides substantial net benefit in persons aged 55 to 80 years at high risk for lung cancer. Evidence from the NLST supports this recommendation because participants in that trial were in this age range and had a similar degree of lung cancer risk from cumulative tobacco exposure. Persons who do not meet the minimum eligibility criteria for the NLST may have less net benefit and more harms from screening (persons aged 55 to 74 years at enrollment who have a &ge;30 pack-year smoking history and are current smokers or have quit in the past 15 years). For these persons, the absolute benefit of screening is strongly associated with their age and smoking history. <br><br>Modeling studies conducted by CISNET investigators for the USPSTF showed that annual LDCT screening yielded the greatest net benefit (compared with biennial or triennial screening). Benefits were measured as percentage of early-stage detection of lung cancer, percentage and absolute number of lung cancer deaths averted, and number of life-years gained. Harms were measured as number of total LDCT screenings per 100,000 persons and per person, number of cases of overdiagnosed lung cancer, and number of radiation-induced lung cancer deaths. The microsimulation models used standardized data on smoking history and non&ndash;lung cancer mortality to simulate the effects of various screening programs on the mortality rate of a U.S. cohort born in 1950. This cohort was chosen because these persons reach age 63 years (approximate midrange of participants' ages in the NLST) in 2013. <br><br>Modeling evidence suggests that an annual screening program starting at age 55 years and ending after age 80 years (in persons who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years) resulted in approximately 50% of lung cancer cases detected at an early stage. This screening protocol would result in a 14% reduction in lung cancer mortality, or an estimated 521 lung cancer deaths prevented per 100,000 persons in the population. The harms associated with this screening protocol are an estimated overdiagnosis of 10% of screen-detected cases and radiation-induced lung cancer deaths of less than 1%. As mentioned previously, a person's absolute net benefit from screening may depend not just on age but functional status and the presence of other comorbid conditions\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nLung cancer is a proliferation of malignant cells arising in the tissues or airways of the lungs. In addition to age and exposure to tobacco smoke, other risk factors for lung cancer include family history; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; pulmonary fibrosis; and exposure to indoor cooking fumes, radon, asbestos, arsenic, chromium, and coal tar. Non&ndash;small cell lung cancer is a heterogeneous category that includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype, encompassing 36% of all lung cancer cases.<br><br>Currently, 75% of patients with lung cancer present with symptoms of advanced local or metastatic disease that result in poor prognosis. At the earliest stage, median 5-year survival for NSCLC is 77%. Patients with localized disease (defined as cancer limited to the lung without metastasis to other organs or lymph nodes) have a median 5-year survival of 52% compared with 25% for those with regional spread and 4% for those with distant metastasis. Thus, earlier detection and treatment of lung cancer give patients a greater chance for cure.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 30 July to 26 August 2013. Most of the comments generally agreed with the recommendation statement, although some suggested restricting screening to a higher-risk group and others suggested expanding eligibility criteria beyond those used in the NLST. Many comments expressed concerns about implementation of a screening program, predicting substantially greater harm in the community setting than was found in the NLST. Some comments expressed concern about the cost of implementing a screening program and the potential paradoxical effect of enabling persons to continue smoking with the perception that medical care can mitigate the risks of smoking.&nbsp; <br><br>In response to these comments, the USPSTF further emphasized the importance of tobacco cessation as the primary way to prevent lung cancer and provided links to resources that clinicians can use to help their patients quit smoking. A section on implementation of a screening program was added, emphasizing the need for monitoring this implementation, quality assurance in diagnostic imaging, and appropriate follow-up to replicate the benefits observed in the NLST in the general population. The USPSTF also clarified that, in addition to age and smoking history, such risk factors as occupational exposure, family history, and history of other lung diseases are important when assessing patients' risks for lung cancer.&nbsp; <br><br>The USPSTF acknowledges the importance of accurately identifying persons who are at highest risk to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of screening and calls for more research to improve risk assessment tools. The USPSTF did not incorporate the costs of a screening program or the potential savings from a reduction in treatment of advanced lung cancer into the recommendation.\r\n<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2>\r\nThis recommendation updates the 2004 recommendation, in which the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against screening for lung cancer in asymptomatic persons with LDCT, chest radiography, sputum cytologic evaluation, or a combination of these tests. In the current recommendation, the USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in persons who are at high risk based on age and cumulative tobacco smoke exposure.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus is glucose intolerance discovered during pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM in the United States is 1% to 25%, depending on patient demographics and diagnostic thresholds. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications, including preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia (which can cause shoulder dystocia and birth injury), and neonatal hypoglycemia. Women with GDM are also at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus; approximately 15% to 60% of women develop type 2 diabetes within 5 to 15 years of delivery. Screening for GDM generally occurs after the 24th week of pregnancy. Screening before 24 weeks may identify women with glucose intolerance earlier in pregnancy.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that primary care providers can accurately detect GDM in asymptomatic pregnant women after 24 weeks of gestation. The most commonly used screening test in the United States is the 50-g oral glucose challenge test (OGCT).Other methods of screening include the fasting plasma glucose test and screening based on risk factors. However, there is limited evidence on these alternative screening approaches. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to compare the effectiveness of different screening tests or thresholds for a positive screen result.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected GDM with dietary modifications, glucose monitoring, and insulin (if needed) can significantly reduce the risk of preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia. When these outcomes are considered collectively, there is a moderate net benefit for both mother and infant. The benefit of treatment on long-term metabolic outcomes in women who are treated for GDM compared with those who are not treated is uncertain.The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether there are benefits to screening for GDM in women before 24 weeks of gestation.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of the harms of screening and treatment is small to none. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated an increase in the number of prenatal visits in screen-detected women who were treated for GDM compared with screen-detected women who were not treated. There was conflicting evidence on the risk for an increase in the induction of labor associated with treatment. No significant differences were reported for cesarean delivery or neonatal intensive care unit admissions between women who were treated and women who were not treated for GDM in the overall pooled meta-analysis. Trials also demonstrated no significant differences in the incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants or episodes of neonatal hypoglycemia, but the trials were not adequately powered to detect meaningful differences in these outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening for gestational diabetes after 24 weeks of gestation to reduce maternal and fetal complications (the collective outcomes of preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia). The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThese recommendations apply to pregnant women who have not been previously diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nSeveral factors increase a woman's risk for developing GDM, including obesity, increased maternal age, history of GDM, family history of diabetes, and belonging to an ethnic group that has increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (Hispanic, Native American, South or East Asian, African American, or Pacific Island descent).<br><br>Factors associated with a lower risk for developing GDM include age younger than 25 to 30 years, white race, a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2or less, no family history (that is, in a first-degree relative) of diabetes, and no history of glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to GDM.\r\n<h3>Screening</h3>\r\nThere are 2 strategies used to screen for gestational diabetes in the United States. In the 2-step approach, the 50-g OGCT is performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state. If the screening threshold is met or exceeded (130, 135, or 140 mg/dL [7.21, 7.49, or 7.77 mmol/L]), patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the OGTT, a fasting glucose level is obtained, followed by administration of a 100-g glucose load, and glucose levels are evaluated after 1, 2, and 3 hours. A diagnosis of GDM is made when 2 or more glucose values fall at or above the specified glucose thresholds. Alternatively, in the 1-step approach, a 75-g glucose load is administered after fasting and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 hours. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed if 1 glucose value falls at or above the specified glucose threshold.\r\n<h3>Timing of Screening</h3>\r\nScreening is recommended after 24 weeks of gestation. Screening for GDM may occur earlier than 24 weeks of gestation in high-risk women, but there is little evidence about the benefits and harms of screening before 24 weeks of gestation.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nInitial treatment includes moderate physical activity, dietary changes, support from diabetes educators and nutritionists, and glucose monitoring. If the patient's glucose is not controlled after these initial interventions, she may be prescribed medication (either insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents), or have increased surveillance in prenatal care or changes in delivery management.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\nIn deciding whether to screen for GDM before 24 weeks of gestation, primary care providers should consider the following.\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nGestational diabetes affects about 240,000 (7%) of the 4 million annual births in the United States. Pregnant women with GDM are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications and may benefit from early identification and treatment. Women with GDM are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nPotential harms of screening for gestational diabetes include psychological harms and intensive medical interventions (induction of labor, cesarean delivery, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit). Possible adverse effects of treatment include neonatal or maternal hypoglycemia and maternal stress.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nA cross-sectional study reported that universal screening is the most common practice in the United States, with 96% of obstetricians routinely screening for GDM. Some women are screened earlier than 24 weeks of gestation because they have risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes, or fetal macrosomia during a previous pregnancy. <br><br>If a pregnant woman presents in the first trimester or in early pregnancy with risk factors for type 2 diabetes, clinicians should use their clinical judgment to determine what is appropriate screening for that individual patient given her health needs and the insufficient evidence.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nMost pregnant women should be encouraged to attain moderate gestational weight gain, based on their prepregnancy BMI, and to participate in physical activity based on their clinician's recommendations. The Institute of Medicine has made recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy based on prepregnancy BMI.<a name=\"other\"></a>\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nMore research is needed to directly evaluate screening for GDM and maternal and infant health outcomes. Research is also needed to help determine the most beneficial glucose thresholds for a positive screen and treatment targets. Continued research is needed to examine alternative screening methods, such as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement and risk factor&#8210;based assessment. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of different treatments for GDM on longer-term metabolic maternal and infant outcomes, such as persistent maternal glucose intolerance after delivery and type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in the mother and infant. The use of a consistent strategy for screening for and diagnosing GDM in studies would allow for better comparisons of treatment outcomes across clinical trials. <br><br>The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women of reproductive age merits consideration of preconception screening for overt diabetes in women who are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to determine whether identifying and treating glucose intolerance before 24 weeks of gestation reduces maternal and fetal complications at delivery or leads to improved long-term health outcomes. For example, a follow-up to the Mild GDM Trial is examining whether different types of interventions in pregnant women with mild GDM decreases the risk for obesity in their children.",

      "other": "In 2013, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended screening all pregnant women with a patient history or the 50-g OGCT. The American Diabetes Association endorses glucose testing for GDM in all pregnant women who do not have a prepregnancy diagnosis of diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation using a 75-g 2-hour OGTT with thresholds proposed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups. In 2013, an independent panel supported by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program considered whether using the 75-g OGTT (1-step approach), as proposed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups and supported by the American Diabetes Association, should be adopted instead of the 2-step approach. The panel released a statement that there is not enough evidence to adopt a 1-step approach. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for GDM in asymptomatic pregnant women after 24 weeks of gestation. It also concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for GDM in asymptomatic pregnant women before 24 weeks of gestation. The Endocrine Society recommends universal screening for GDM using the OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.",
      "otherUrl": "http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/gdm/gdmfinalrs.htm#recommendations",
      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nThe prevalence of GDM in the United States is about 6% to 7%, affecting approximately 240,000 of 4 million annual births. However, the prevalence of GDM depends on the diagnostic criteria used and the population screened and ranges in studies from 1.1% to 25.5%. Gestational diabetes generally resolves postpartum; however, women who have GDM are at increased risk of developing overt type 2 diabetes mellitus. In fact, 15% to 60% of women with GDM develop type 2 diabetes mellitus within 5 to 15 years postpartum. Screening for gestational diabetes may have important implications in the prevention of overt type 2 diabetes.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nIn 2008, the USPSTF<strong> </strong>concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for GDM either before or after 24 weeks of gestation. To update the 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on the accuracy of screening tests, the benefits and harms of screening before and after 24 weeks of gestation, and the benefits and harms of treatment for the mother and infant. Pregestational diabetes (undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus) is not the focus of this recommendation.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening</h3>\r\nFifty-one studies of fair to good quality assessed the accuracy and yield of various screening tests, including the 50-g OGCT, fasting plasma glucose test, HbA1c test, and screening based on risk factors, after 24 weeks of gestation. The reference standard varied and included criteria from Carpenter and Coustan, the American Diabetes Association (2000&ndash;2010), the National Diabetes Data Group, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The studies were from a range of populations and settings, and the prevalence of GDM varied from 1.4% to 50%. The lack of an established gold standard for the diagnosis of GDM limits the USPSTF's ability to compare results of studies that used different diagnostic criteria. Data on screening and diagnostic tests for GDM before 24 weeks of gestation were limited. <br><br>Nine studies provided data to estimate sensitivity and specificity of OGCT using a cut-point of 140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L) or greater. Gestational diabetes was confirmed by a 100-g 3-hour OGTT using Carpenter and Coustan criteria. The joint estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 85% and 86%, respectively. Six studies reported results for a 50-g OGCT using a cut-point of 130 mg/dL (7.21 mmol/L) or greater. Gestational diabetes was confirmed using Carpenter and Coustan criteria. The joint estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 99% and 77%, respectively. A 50-g OGCT with a cut-point of 130 mg/dL (7.21 mmol/L) had higher sensitivity compared with a cut-point of 140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L); however, specificity was lower. <br><br>Seven studies assessed the fasting plasma glucose test; GDM was confirmed using Carpenter and Coustan criteria. Four fasting plasma glucose thresholds were compared; sensitivity was 87% and specificity was 52% for 85 mg/dL (4.72 mmol/L) or greater, 77% and 76% for 90 mg/dL (5.00 mmol/L) or greater, 76% and 92% for 92 mg/dL (5.11 mmol/L) or greater, and 54% and 93% for 95 mg/dL (5.27 mmol/L) or greater. Although both the OGCT and the fasting plasma glucose (85 mg/dL [4.72 mmol/L]) test can rule out women who do not have GDM by 24 weeks of gestation, the OGCT is better at identifying women who have an abnormal response to larger glucose loads. <br><br>Limited evidence demonstrated that the HbA1c test has poorer test characteristics than the OGCT. A study in the United Arab Emirates using an A1c value of 5.5% or greater had a specificity of 21% and a sensitivity of 82% (using Carpenter and Coustan criteria). A Turkish study reported that an A1c cut-point of 7.2% or greater had 64% sensitivity and specificity (using Carpenter and Coustan criteria). However, a highly elevated A1c level supports a possible diagnosis of overt diabetes in pregnancy.Data on screening based on risk factors were limited. Studies that examined risk factors for screening used different diagnostic criteria and could not be pooled due to heterogeneity; sensitivity and specificity varied widely.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo RCTs addressed the direct benefits or harms of screening for GDM. Five fair- to good-quality RCTs and 6 retrospective cohort studies evaluated the benefits and harms of treatment compared with usual care of mild, screen-detected GDM identified at or after 24 weeks of gestation. The studies used a variety of glucose inclusion criteria and assessed short- and long-term outcomes in the mother and infant. All studies compared usual care with diet modification, glucose monitoring, and insulin as needed. The 2 largest RCTs, the Mild GDM Trial and the Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance in Pregnancy Study (ACHOIS), used different diagnostic glucose thresholds (Carpenter and Coustan [fasting glucose cut-point of &lt;95 mg/dL (5.27 mmol/L)] and WHO criteria, respectively), but patients' mean fasting glucose levels at study entry were similar. <br><br>Evidence from 11 studies demonstrated fewer cases of preeclampsia (3 RCTs; <em>n</em> = 2014), shoulder dystocia (3 RCTs and 4 cohort studies; <em>n</em> = 3054), and macrosomia (5 RCTs; <em>n</em>= 2643) in women who were treated for GDM compared with those who were not treated. Outcomes that had inconsistent evidence or did not demonstrate significant differences between groups included maternal weight gain, birth injury, brachial plexus injury and clavicular fracture, hyperbilirubinemia, perinatal death, and respiratory distress syndrome.<br><br>The overall evidence was strongly influenced by the 2 largest RCTs, the Mild GDM Trial and ACHOIS. The fair-quality Mild GDM Trial included 958 women at 24 to 31 weeks of gestation with mild GDM (based on abnormal results on the OGTT and a fasting plasma glucose level of &lt;95 mg/dL [5.27 mmol/L]) who were randomly assigned to an intervention group that received dietary intervention, glucose self-monitoring, and insulin (if needed) or to a control group of usual care. The good-quality ACHOIS included 1000 women at 24 to 34 weeks of gestation with mild GDM (based on WHO criteria) who were randomly assigned to dietary intervention, glucose self-monitoring, and insulin (if needed) or to a control group of usual care.\r\n<h4>Maternal Outcomes</h4>\r\nThree fair- and good-quality RCTs and 1 good-quality cohort study provided evidence on preeclampsia. The pooled estimate from the RCTs (<em>n</em> = 2014) showed a significant difference favoring the treatment group (risk ratio [RR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.89]), with little statistical heterogeneity across the trials. The cohort study (<em>n</em> = 258) showed no significant difference in preeclampsia. <br><br>In ACHOIS, anxiety and depression were measured at 6 weeks and 3 months postpartum in a subgroup (<em>n</em>= 568) of participants. There was no significant difference between groups in anxiety, but there were significantly lower rates of depression in the treatment group at 3 months postpartum (RR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.79]). <br><br>No studies provided evidence on long-term maternal outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension.\r\n<h4>Infant Outcomes</h4>\r\nThe pooled estimate from 3 fair- and good-quality RCTs (<em>n</em> = 2044) showed a significant decrease in shoulder dystocia in the treatment group (RR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.77]). Four good-quality cohort studies (<em>n</em> = 3054) also showed a significant difference favoring the treatment group (RR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.78]). There was no statistical heterogeneity across the studies (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/gdm/gdmfinalrs.htm#ref1\">1</a>). A pooled estimate from 5 fair- and good-quality RCTs showed significantly lower incidence of macrosomia (&gt;4000 g) in infants in the treatment groups (RR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.71]; <em>n</em> = 2643), with moderate heterogeneity across the studies. Pooled estimates were not assessed for 6 cohort studies (<em>n</em> = 3426) because of significant heterogeneity (<em>I2</em>=86%). <br><br>One small RCT (n=89) followed a subset of children for 7 to 11 years and found no differences for impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or BMI greater than the 95th percentile between the offspring of the treatment and control groups. Another RCT (<em>n</em> = 199) assessed BMI greater than the 85th percentile in children followed for 4 to 5 years and also did not show a difference between offspring of the treatment and control groups. Pooled results from 2 RCTs (<em>n</em>= 284) showed no difference in BMI greater than the 85th percentile.\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Maternal Outcomes</h4>\r\nOne RCT (ACHOIS) assessed anxiety and depression in a subgroup of study participants after study enrollment. As previously discussed, rates of depression at 3 months postpartum were significantly lower in women who were treated for GDM than in those who were not treated for GDM. These results should be interpreted with caution because the assessment of depression and anxiety was conducted in a subgroup of the larger RCT. <br><br>Two RCTs reported an increase in the number of prenatal visits in screen-detected women who were treated for GDM compared with those who were not treated. The Mild GDM Trial reported 7 prenatal visits in the treatment group versus 5 in the control group (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001). ACHOIS reported more clinic visits (with a physician, dietician, or diabetes educator) but fewer antenatal visits in the treatment group compared with the control group. <br><br>Evidence on the risk for an increased rate of induction of labor was conflicting. Two RCTs showed no overall difference (RR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.49]; <em>n</em> = 1931), while 1 cohort study reported significantly fewer inductions in the treatment group compared with the nontreatment group (RR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.72]; <em>n</em> = 1665). The cohort study results may be due to confounding by the different delivery protocols between treated and untreated groups. <br><br>Pooled estimates from trials (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.01]; <em>n</em> = 2613) and from cohort studies (RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.31]; <em>n</em> = 3110) showed no significant differences between treated and untreated groups for cesarean delivery. One RCT and 1 cohort study found no differences between groups in emergency cesarean delivery (RCT RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.05]; <em>n </em>= 1000; cohort RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.33 to 2.06]; <em>n </em>= 126).\r\n<h4>Infant Outcomes</h4>\r\nThree RCTs (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.67 to 1.37]; <em>n</em> = 2262) and 1 cohort study (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.19 to 2.35]; <em>n</em> = 126) reported no significant differences in admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit. Four trials also demonstrated no significant differences between groups in incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants (RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.48]; <em>n</em> = 1168). Pooled results of 4 RCTs showed no significant differences between groups in episodes of neonatal hypoglycemia (RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.52]; <em>n</em> = 2367). Two cohort studies reported conflicting results on neonatal hypoglycemia, possibly because of differing definitions of hypoglycemia or screening practices (overall RR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.10 to 2.97]; <em>n</em> = 2054). <br><br>The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Study has shown a continuous relationship between fetal outcomes (increased birth weight, cord blood serum C-peptide levels, neonatal hypoglycemia, and primary cesarean delivery) and varying levels of maternal glycemia below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes. This study was an international observational study (<em>n </em>= 25,505) of women receiving the 75-g OGTT. However, there was no clear glucose threshold at which risk was increased for fetal overgrowth or other maternal and neonatal outcomes.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF determined that screening for and treatment of GDM in women after 24 weeks of gestation are associated with moderate health improvements in the mother and infant through the collective reduction in preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia. The harms of screening or treatment are considered no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate.<br><br>The USPSTF was not able to estimate the magnitude of net benefit for screening for or treatment of GDM before 24 weeks of gestation because of limited evidence.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nScreening for GDM occurs between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy. Women with GDM are at increased risk for maternal and infant complications. Screening for and detecting GDM provides a potential opportunity to prevent adverse outcomes. Once detected, GDM may return in subsequent pregnancies and is associated with an increased future risk for developing overt diabetes.&nbsp; <br><br>The evidence shows a benefit of screening and treatment on the collective outcomes of preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia. In addition to being at increased risk for eclampsia, women who are diagnosed with preeclampsia are at risk for a cascade of interventions, including further monitoring, additional medications, and earlier delivery. Macrosomia can be diagnosed before delivery, possibly allowing for the prevention of negative downstream effects. Infants with macrosomia are at risk for shoulder dystocia, which results in an increased risk for clavicular fracture and, more seriously, brachial plexus palsy.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 28 May to 24 June 2013. In response to these comments, the USPSTF added language to the Rationale section about the link between GDM and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The USPSTF also added language to emphasize the scope of the recommendation statement, and additional language describing gaps in the evidence was added to the Research Needs and Gaps section.<a name=\"update\"></a>\r\n<h2>Update of Previous Recommendation</h2>\r\nIn 2008, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for GDM before or after 24 weeks of gestation. To update this recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed the indirect chain of evidence and found adequate evidence that screening for and treatment of GDM can significantly reduce the risk for preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia. When assessing these outcomes collectively, the USPSTF concluded that there is a moderate net benefit for the mother and infant. As a result of the evidence, the USPSTF changed its recommendation for screening after 24 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grades.htm#brec\">B recommendation</a>). However, the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation remains insufficient.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Use of dietary supplements is common in the U.S. adult population. Forty-nine percent of adults used at least 1 dietary supplement between 2007 and 2010, and 32% reported using a multivitamin&ndash;multimineral supplement. Supplement use is more common among women and older adults than men and younger adults. Most dietary supplements are used to improve or maintain overall health. The substantial effect of cardiovascular disease and cancer on health status and mortality in the United States has been well-described, and many supplements are promoted to prevent these conditions.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Vitamin Supplementation</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of supplementation with multivitamins to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease or cancer. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of supplementation with individual vitamins or minerals or functional pairs in healthy populations without known nutritional deficiencies to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease or cancer. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with &beta;-carotene or vitamin E in healthy populations without known nutritional deficiencies does not reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease or cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Vitamin Supplementation</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of supplementation with multivitamins and most single vitamins or minerals or functional pairs. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with &beta;-carotene increases the risk for lung cancer in persons who are at increased risk for this condition. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with vitamin E has few or no substantial harms.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of supplementation with multivitamins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of supplementation with single or paired nutrients (except &beta;-carotene or vitamin E) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is no net benefit of supplementation with vitamin E or &beta;-carotene for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThe focus of this recommendation is healthy adults without special nutritional needs. Populations studied were typically aged 50 years or older. This recommendation does not apply to children, women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, or persons who are chronically ill or hospitalized or have a known nutritional deficiency.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden </em></h4>\r\nEvidence from in vitro and animal research and population-based epidemiologic studies supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress may play a fundamental role in the initiation and progression of cancer and common cardiovascular diseases. If this hypothesis is correct, then some combination of specific supplements, a specific dose, a vulnerable host, and specific timing may be found to be useful.\r\n<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>\r\nImportant harms have been shown with the use of &beta;-carotene in persons who smoke tobacco or have an occupational exposure to asbestos. There are several known adverse effects caused by excessive doses of vitamins; for example, moderate doses of vitamin A supplements may reduce bone mineral density, but high doses may be hepatotoxic or teratogenic. Otherwise, the vitamins reviewed by the USPSTF had few known risks. Because many of these vitamins are fat soluble, the lifetime effect of high doses should be taken into consideration.<br><br>The USPSTF did not address doses higher than the tolerable upper intake level, as determined by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board. Vitamins A and D have known harms at doses exceeding the tolerable upper intake levels, and the potential for harm from other supplements at high doses should be carefully considered. <br><br>The U.S. Pharmacopeia has developed reference standards to aid in quality control of dietary supplement production; however, the content and concentration of ingredients in commercially available formulations probably vary considerably. This variability in the composition of dietary supplements makes extrapolating results obtained from controlled clinical trials challenging.\r\n<h4><em>Costs </em></h4>\r\nAlthough dietary supplements themselves are not particularly costly, the cumulative effect of this class of agent on spending is substantial. In 2010, $28.1 billion was spent on dietary supplements in the United States.\r\n<h4><em>Current Practice </em></h4>\r\nSurveys conducted by the dietary supplement industry suggest that many physicians and nurses have recommended dietary supplements to their patients for health and wellness.\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nAppropriate intake of vitamin and mineral nutrients is essential to overall health. Despite the uncertain benefit of vitamin supplementation, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that nutrients should come primarily from foods and provide guidance on how to consume a nutrient-rich diet. Adequate nutrition by eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, and seafood has been associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer. <br><br>Specific groups of patients with well-defined conditions may benefit from specific nutrients. For example, women planning or capable of pregnancy should receive a daily supplement containing folic acid to help prevent neural tube defects. The USPSTF also recommends vitamin D supplements for older persons at risk for falling.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has a large portfolio of recommendations for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, including recommendations for smoking cessation; screening for lipid disorders, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer; obesity screening and counseling; and aspirin use (available at <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). <br><br>\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nA critical gap in the evidence is the lack of studies of multivitamin combinations in groups generalizable to the U.S. population. Two randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of multivitamin supplements suggest a potential cancer prevention benefit in men but not women. Future trials should be more representative of the general population, including women and minority groups, and should have enough power to show whether there are true subgroup differences. Targeting research toward persons who can be identified as high-risk for nutrient deficiency rather than the general population may be more productive. <br><br>There are substantial challenges to studying nutrient supplementation by using methods similar to those used in studying pharmaceutical interventions. New and innovative research methods for examining effects of nutrients that account for the unique complexities of nutritional research but maintain rigorous designs should be explored. <br><br>The paucity of studies and general lack of effect of any single nutrient or nutrient pair makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions on the balance of benefits and harms without a coordinated research effort and focus. A general lack of standardized methods to determine relevant serum nutrient levels, agreement on thresholds for sufficiency and insufficiency, or predictive validity of current mechanistic models further hinders progress in understanding potential benefits of dietary supplements.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nCardiovascular disease and cancer are the largest contributors to the burden of chronic disease in the developed world. In 2011, these diseases accounted for 23.7% and 22.8% of all deaths in the United States, respectively.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nIn order to update its 2003 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence of the efficacy of the use of multivitamin or mineral supplements in the general adult population for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. The value of vitamins that naturally occur in food and the use of vitamin supplements for the prevention of other conditions (for example, neural tube defects) and for the secondary prevention of complications in patients with existing disease are outside the scope of this review.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<h4><em>Multivitamin and Antioxidant Combinations</em></h4>\r\nThe USPSTF reviewed 4 RCTs and 1 cohort study assessing health outcomes of a multivitamin supplement. The studies varied in the nutrients and doses used. No effect on all-cause mortality was found in the 3 trials that assessed this outcome. Two trials assessed cardiovascular disease outcomes. Overall, there was no effect on incidence of cardiovascular disease events. One trial reported a borderline significant decrease in fatal myocardial infarctions. <br><br>Two large trials, the Physicians' Health Study II and the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation in Vitamins and Mineral Antioxidants) study, showed a decrease in overall cancer incidence in men (pooled unadjusted relative risk, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.87 to 0.99]). The Physicians' Health Study II included 14,641 male U.S. physicians with an average age of 64.3 years. The intervention used a commercially available multivitamin that contained 30 ingredients. The unadjusted relative risk for total cancer incidence was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.00) after 11.2 years of follow-up. The homogeneity of this study population (primarily older white male physicians) limits its generalizability. <br><br>The SU.VI.MAX study was conducted in France in 13,017 men and women with an average age of 49 years. The intervention supplement included nutritional doses of vitamins C and E plus &beta;-carotene, selenium, and zinc. Outcomes were reported for the end of the intervention phase at 7.5 years and again at 12.5 years after randomization. During the supplementation period, overall cancer incidence was not affected in women but decreased by 31% in men (adjusted relative risk, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.91]). The lack of effect in women and the use of different supplement formulations in the 2 trials make extrapolating these findings to the general population difficult.\r\n<h4><em>Single and Paired Vitamins and Minerals</em></h4>\r\nThe USPSTF reviewed 24 studies of individual vitamins or minerals or functional nutrient pairs. Across all of the supplements studied, there was no evidence of beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease, cancer, or all-cause mortality. However, there are only a limited number of studies for most individual nutrients and differences in study designs make pooling effects across supplements difficult. Therefore, the USPSTF is not able to conclude with certainty that there is no effect. The evidence for each individual nutrient is discussed here. <strong><br><br>Vitamin A.</strong> The USPSTF reviewed 3 RCTs and 2 cohort studies of vitamin A. None of the studies reported cardiovascular disease incidence. One good-quality trial showed an increased risk for lung cancer and related death. The baseline population (smokers and workers who had been exposed to asbestos) was at high risk for lung cancer, so the increased mortality may be attributable to the &beta;-carotene component. Two trials reported all-cause mortality, but no significant difference was observed between intervention and control groups at the longest follow-up. Increased risk for hip fractures was observed in 1 large prospective cohort study of postmenopausal women. <br><br><strong>Vitamin C.</strong> Two RCTs studied the effects of vitamin C, either alone or in combination with other supplements, and found no statistically significant effect on cardiovascular disease, cancer, or all-cause mortality. <br><br><strong>Vitamin D With or Without Calcium.</strong> Three trials studied the effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular disease and cancer. Two trials found no effect on cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality. One trial reported cancer incidence and death and found no difference between intervention and control groups. Two trials reporting all-cause mortality found no statistically significant difference. <br><br>Two trials studied vitamin D and calcium combined. One small, fair-quality study found a statistically significant decreased risk for cancer with supplement use. The WHI (Women's Health Initiative) trial, a larger, good-quality trial using lower doses of vitamin D and calcium supplements, found no effect on cancer incidence or mortality. A post hoc subgroup analysis of women who were not receiving supplements at baseline showed an association between use of vitamin D and calcium supplements and lower total cancer and breast cancer incidence. Only the WHI trial reported cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality and all-cause mortality, and it found no effect after 7 years of follow-up. Four trials of calcium supplementation found no effect on overall cardiovascular disease, cancer, or all-cause mortality. <br><br><strong>Vitamin E.</strong> Six RCTs assessed vitamin E supplementation. Three trials reported cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. One trial in women reported a lower cardiovascular disease mortality rate in the intervention group, but mortality rates for myocardial infarction and stroke did not differ statistically. One trial found an increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke in the intervention group. Four RCTs reported cancer incidence. Overall, there was no significant effect on incidence of all types of cancer or on cancer mortality rates. No effect on all-cause mortality was observed in the 5 trials reporting this outcome. Vitamin E was not found to have any effect on site-specific cancer incidence, although the results for prostate cancer were mixed. The ATBC (Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention) study reported a decreased incidence of prostate cancer, but the effect did not persist with longer follow-up. Conversely, SELECT (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial)&nbsp;reported an increased risk for prostate cancer after extended follow-up. <br><br><strong>&beta;-Carotene.</strong> A consistent body of evidence from 6 clinical trials suggests that &beta;-carotene supplementation does not decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease events, overall cancer incidence, or cancer mortality. Two trials, the ATBC study&nbsp;and CARET (Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial), showed an increased risk for lung cancer incidence and mortality and all-cause mortality in participants with a high baseline risk for lung cancer. A meta-analysis of &beta;-carotene trials reported an increased risk for lung cancer (pooled odds ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.39]) in current smokers. <br><strong><br>Selenium.</strong> Two trials studied selenium alone or in combination with other nutrients and found no effect on cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality. The effect on cancer was mixed. One trial found a decrease in risk for cancer incidence and mortality; the other found no significant difference. Additional analyses showed a decrease in cancer incidence only in men with the lowest levels of selenium, suggesting a potential effect resulting from treatment of selenium deficiency. No differences in all-cause mortality were found in either trial. <br><br><strong>Folic Acid.</strong>Only 1 trial studied folic acid. It found no effect on cardiovascular disease incidence or all-cause mortality. There was an increased incidence of cancer, attributed to an excess number of deaths from prostate cancer in the intervention group.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\nOverall, few significant harms were reported from these interventions except for &beta;-carotene. As described previously, 2 trials reported increased risk for lung cancer and lung cancer mortality in smokers, especially heavy smokers. No trials observed an increased risk for cancer in nonsmokers.<br><br>The literature contains reports of less serious harms, such as hypercarotenemia or yellowing of the skin (multivitamins and &beta;-carotene), rashes (multivitamins), minor bleeding events (multivitamins), and gastrointestinal symptoms (calcium and selenium). Rare but more serious harms were associated with some nutrient trials, including hip fractures (vitamin A), prostate cancer (folic acid), and kidney stones (vitamin D and calcium).\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of multivitamin supplements to prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is lacking and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of supplementation with most single or paired vitamins or minerals and is therefore unable to determine the balance of benefits and harms of their use to prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer. <br><br>Only 2 vitamin supplements have sufficient data to estimate net benefit. &beta;-Carotene has been associated with a statistically significant increased risk for lung cancer in smokers. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of &beta;-carotene supplementation is negative (that is, there is a net harm). <br><br>A large and consistent body of evidence has shown that vitamin E supplementation has no effect on cardiovascular disease, cancer, or all-cause mortality. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of vitamin E supplementation is zero.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nThe risk factors for cardiovascular disease are well-established. Risk factors for cancer are considerably more complex because of the heterogeneous nature of different types of cancer and environmental and genetic influences. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and methionine metabolism have been theorized as common pathologic mechanisms for cardiovascular disease and cancer. <br><br>The potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of many nutrient supplements are the basis for their proposed use to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer. The oxidative properties of antioxidants are not fully understood; however, research has suggested that these properties may vary in relation to other factors, such as the concentration of the nutrient and presence of other oxidants or antioxidants. The harmful association between &beta;-carotene and lung cancer suggests that other variables may influence whether &beta;-carotene acts as an antioxidant versus a pro-oxidant.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 12 November to 9 December 2013. In response to these comments, the USPSTF added language emphasizing that the harms of &beta;-carotene were found in persons at increased risk for lung cancer. The discussion of vitamin E was revised to clarify the consistency of evidence showing a lack of benefit. Additional language was added to the Research Needs and Gaps section to highlight other challenges in nutrient research. The Recommendations of Others section was enhanced with recommendations from additional organizations.<a name=\"update\"></a>\r\n<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2>\r\nThis recommendation updates the 2003 USPSTF recommendation on vitamin supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer. At that time, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against the use of supplements of vitamins A, C, or E; multivitamins with folic acid; or antioxidant combinations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer (I statement). The USPSTF also recommended against the use of &beta;-carotene supplements, either alone or in combination with other supplements, for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer (D recommendation). <br><br>In the current recommendation, the USPSTF considered evidence on additional nutrient supplements, including vitamin D, calcium, selenium, and folic acid, for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. New evidence on the use of vitamin E increased the USPSTF's certainty about its lack of effectiveness in preventing these conditions.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States. According to the 1999&ndash;2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately 42% of children ages 2 to 11 years have dental caries in their primary teeth. After decreasing from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, the prevalence of dental caries in children has been increasing, particularly in young children ages 2 to 5 years.</p>\r\n<h3>Recognition of Risk Status</h3>\r\n<p>Risk assessment tools generally evaluate risk based on factors such as demographic risk, personal and family oral health history, dietary habits, fluoride exposure, and oral hygiene practices. Information from a clinical evaluation has also been proposed, as well as qualitative or quantitative measure of oral bacterial load. The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the accuracy of risk assessment instruments for future dental caries in the primary care setting.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of <strong>Preventive Interventions and Early Detection</strong></h3>\r\n<h4>Preventive Interventions</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that oral fluoride supplementation, also known as dietary fluoride supplementation, in children who have low levels of fluoride in their water and application of fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all children can each provide moderate benefit in preventing dental caries.The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on the benefits of provider education of parents regarding oral hygiene practices to prevent dental caries in their children.</p>\r\n<h4>Screening</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies addressing the direct effect of routine oral screening examinations performed by primary care clinicians on improved clinical outcomes in children younger than age 5 years.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Interventions and Early Detection</h3>\r\n<h4>Preventive Interventions</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence of a link between early childhood exposure to systemic fluoride and enamel fluorosis, a visible change in the appearance of the enamel due to altered mineralization. Fluorosis can range from mild (small white spots or streaks) to severe (discoloration, pitting, or rough enamel), depending on the overall systemic fluoride exposure level over time.No studies specifically reported on the risk for fluorosis with fluoride varnish; however, compared with other topical fluoride interventions, systematic exposure to fluoride is low after varnish application. It is important to consider a child's overall systemic exposure to fluoride from multiple sources (e.g., water fluoridation, toothpaste, supplements, and/or varnish), but in the United States, enamel fluorosis presents as mild cosmetic changes in &gt;99% of cases.The USPSTF concludes that there is limited evidence about the harms associated with fluoride varnish or other preventive interventions for dental caries, but that these risks are likely small.</p>\r\n<h4>Screening</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies addressing the magnitude of harms of screening children from birth to age 5 years for dental caries or future risk for dental caries in the primary care setting.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of preventing future dental caries with oral fluoride supplementation at recommended doses in children older than age 6 months who reside in communities with inadequate water fluoride. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of preventing future dental caries with fluoride varnish application in all children starting at the age of eruption of primary teeth to age 5 years. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on performing routine oral screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to children age 5 years and younger.<br><br>The USPSTF limited its consideration of caries screening and prevention by primary care clinicians to infants and preschool-aged children. The rationale for this decision was that, at the present time, nondental primary care clinicians are more likely than dentists to have contact with children ages 5 years and younger in the United States; this situation changes as children reach school age and beyond. In addition, as children grow older, dental professionals use sealants rather than fluoride varnish. As such, the USPSTF limited its review of the evidence of preventive interventions for dental caries to this age group. This recommendation should not be construed to imply that preventive interventions for dental caries should cease after 5 years of age.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nAll children are at potential risk for dental caries; those whose primary water supply is deficient in fluoride (defined as containing &lt;0.6 ppm F) are at particular risk. While there are no validated multivariate screening tools to determine which children are at higher risk for dental caries, there are a number of individual factors that elevate risk. Higher prevalence and severity of dental caries are found among minority and economically disadvantaged children. Other risk factors for caries in children include frequent sugar exposure, inappropriate bottle feeding, developmental defects of the tooth enamel, dry mouth, and a history of previous caries. Maternal and family factors can also increase children's risk. These factors include poor oral hygiene, low socioeconomic status, recent maternal caries, sibling caries, and frequent snacking. Additional factors associated with dental caries in young children include lack of access to dental care; inadequate preventive measures, such as failure to use fluoride-containing toothpastes; and lack of parental knowledge about oral health.<br><br>Some organizations have advocated restricting fluoride varnish use to children at &ldquo;increased risk.&rdquo; Although several caries risk assessment tools exist, none have been validated in the primary care setting, nor do existing studies demonstrate that these tools, when used by primary care clinicians, can accurately and consistently differentiate between children who will develop dental caries and those who will not. A risk-based approach to fluoride varnish application will miss opportunities to provide an effective dental caries preventive intervention to children who could benefit from it, particularly because currently, in the United States, infants and preschool-aged children are more likely to have regular visits with nondental primary care clinicians than dental care providers.\r\n<h3>Interventions to Prevent Dental Caries</h3>\r\nAs noted previously, oral fluoride supplementation prevents dental caries in patients with inadequate water fluoridation.<br><br>All children with erupted teeth can potentially benefit from the periodic application of fluoride varnish, regardless of the levels of fluoride in their water. Though the evidence to support varnish is drawn from higher-risk populations, the provision of varnish to all children is reasonable since the prevalence of risk factors is high in the U.S. population, the number needed to treat is low, and the harms of the intervention are small to none.<br><br>The USPSTF did not review the evidence on the effectiveness of tooth brushing, but regular tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste by children is very important in preventing dental caries.\r\n<h3>Timing and Dosage of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\nNo studies specifically addressed the dosage and timing of oral fluoride supplementation in children with inadequate water fluoridation. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommendations on the dosage of and age at which to start dietary fluoride supplementation take into account the amount of fluoride in the child's water source. These dosing recommendations are also referenced by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).<br><br>No study directly assessed the appropriate ages at which to start and stop the application of fluoride varnish. Available trials of fluoride varnish enrolled children ages 3 to 5 years; however, given the mechanism of action of this intervention, benefits are very likely to accrue starting at the time of primary tooth eruption. Limited evidence found no clear effect on caries increment between performing a single fluoride varnish once every 6 months versus once a year or between a single application every 6 months versus multiple applications once a year or every 6 months.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>\r\nIn deciding whether to routinely perform screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years, clinicians should consider the following.\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nDental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States. It is four times more common than childhood asthma and seven times more common than hay fever. According to the NHANES, the prevalence of dental caries has risen from 24% to 28% between 1988&ndash;1994 and 1999&ndash;2004. Approximately 20% of surveyed children with caries had not received treatment. Symptomatic dental caries in children are associated with pain, loss of teeth, impaired growth, and decreased weight gain and can affect appearance, self-esteem, speech, and school performance. Dental-related concerns lead to the loss of more than 54 million school hours each year .\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nNo studies examined the harms of performing primary care screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years. However, given the noninvasive nature of an oral examination, these harms are expected to be minimal.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nIn one study, only about half of pediatricians reported examining the teeth of half of their patients ages 0 to 3 years.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nIn April 2013, the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommended fluoridation of community water sources based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing dental caries. It also recommends school-based dental sealant delivery programs to prevent caries. Xylitol may have promise as an additional method to reduce the risk for dental caries.<br><br>Xylitol is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a dietary supplement and is found in over-the-counter consumer products such as wipes or gum. A single small, fair-quality trial of xylitol wipes use in children ages 6 to 35 months found a 91% relative reduction in decayed, missing, or filled surface increment. However, four other studies showed no clear effect of xylitol on caries risk in children younger than age 5 years. As such, there is currently not enough evidence to formally recommend its routine use in caries prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\nMany primary care providers already prescribe oral fluoride supplementation to patients with low levels of fluoride in their water; however, application of fluoride varnish is not currently commonly performed in many primary care offices (estimated at about 4% of practices in 2009). The techniques for application are simple and easy to learn, and fluoride varnish does not require specialized equipment or personnel and can be applied quickly. However, providers and other qualified staff may require some training before offering this procedure. Dentists and physicians can apply varnish in all states. In some states, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and medical assistants can also do so. <br><br>Efforts are underway to address concerns surrounding resources, infrastructure, training, and payment mechanisms for the provision of fluoride varnish in the nondental primary care setting. For example, the AAP Section on Oral Health has partnered with the Health Resources and Services Administration's Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the ADA Foundation to educate and advocate for primary pediatric care professionals to apply fluoride varnish. They have created a Web site with a number of helpful tools and resources to assist nondental primary care providers, including how to acquire the materials required to provide varnish, as well as state-by-state information on billing codes and any training requirements (available at <a href=\"http://www2.aap.org/oralhealth/PracticeTools.html\">http://www2.aap.org/oralhealth/PracticeTools.html</a>). The National Interprofessional Initiative on Oral Health, a consortium of funders and health professionals, focuses on educating and training primary care clinicians on oral health prevention (additional information available at <a href=\"http://www.niioh.org/\">http://www.niioh.org</a>).\r\n<h3>Cost</h3>\r\nState Medicaid reimbursement for fluoride varnish application, when offered, ranges from $9 to $53 per application when applied by licensed providers who have had appropriate training, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and licensed practical nurses (varying by state).\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nStudies are needed to assess and validate multivariate risk assessment tools that can accurately identify high-risk populations most likely to benefit from caries preventive interventions, such as fluoride varnish. <br><br>Further research would also be helpful to confirm the benefits of fluoride varnish among lower-risk and younger children. <br><br>Racial and ethnic minority children, as well as children living in low socioeconomic conditions, are at significantly increased risk for caries compared with white children and children who live in adequate to high socioeconomic conditions. Future studies on risk assessment and preventive interventions should enroll sufficient numbers of racial and ethnic minority children to understand the benefits and harms of interventions in these specific populations. <br><br>More research is also needed to estimate the effectiveness of interventions by clinicians to educate parents and caregivers about optimum health practices for oral hygiene at home.",

      "other": "The AAP has issued two policy statements related to dental care in children. The first, issued in 2003 and reaffirmed in 2009, encourages providers to incorporate oral health&ndash;related services into their practices. Specifically, the AAP recommends an oral health assessment for all children by age 6 months and a first dental visit by age 1 year. The second statement supports oral fluoride supplementation and application of fluoride varnish in children &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; for dental caries. <br><br>The ADA recommends that children be seen by a dentist within 6 months of eruption of the first tooth and no later than age 12 months. It also recommends the application of fluoride varnish every 6 months in preschool-aged children who are at &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; risk for dental caries and every 3 to 6 months in children who are at &ldquo;high&rdquo; risk. It recommends daily dietary fluoride supplements for children from birth to age 16 years who are at &ldquo;high&rdquo; risk for developing dental caries and whose primary source of drinking water is deficient in fluoride; &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; status can be determined using risk assessment tools developed by one of several professional health organizations. Dietary fluoride supplementation is not recommended when water fluoridation levels are greater than 0.6 ppm F. <br><br>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that clinicians counsel parents about appropriate use of fluoridated toothpastes, especially in children age 2 years and younger; prescribe fluoride supplements to children at high risk for dental caries whose drinking water lacks adequate fluoridation; and limit the use of high-concentration fluoride products, such as varnish and gel, to high-risk individuals. <br><br>The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry states that fluoride dietary supplements should be considered for children at risk for caries who drink fluoride-deficient (&lt;0.6 ppm) water. It also states that children at increased risk for caries should receive a professional fluoride treatment (e.g., 5% sodium fluoride varnish or 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride) every 6 months. <br><br>The American Academy of Family Physicians is updating its recommendations on the subject.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nDental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States, and is increasing in prevalence among young children. According to the NHANES, the prevalence of tooth decay in primary teeth in children ages 2 to 5 years increased from approximately 24% to 28% between 1988&ndash;1994 and 1999&ndash;2004. Approximately 20% of surveyed children with caries had not received treatment for the condition. <br><br>In addition, the NHANES found that among children ages 2 to 11 years, 54% of children in households living below the federal poverty threshold had primary dental caries, as well as one third of children in households living 200% above the poverty threshold. Fifty-five percent of Mexican American children have dental caries compared with 43% of African American children and 39% of white children. Mexican American children are also more likely to have untreated dental caries (33%) than African American (28%) and white (20%) children.<br><br>Early childhood caries can cause pain, loss of teeth, caries later in life, impaired growth/weight gain, missed school days, and negative effects on quality of life. Caries in early childhood are associated with failure to thrive and can affect speech, appearance, and school performance. They are also associated with an increased risk for caries in additional primary or permanent teeth. More than 51 million hours of school are missed each year because of childhood dental concerns.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nTo update the 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on prevention of dental caries by primary care clinicians in children age 5 years and younger. The review focused on screening for caries, assessment of risk for future caries, and the effectiveness of various medications that have possible benefits in preventing caries.\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\nNo studies assessed the effectiveness of the use of formal risk assessment tools by primary care clinicians in identifying children at highest risk for dental caries. Although there are tools available from several professional organizations for use in the primary care setting, no studies evaluated their performance or use.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<h4>Fluoride Supplementation</h4>\r\nSix older studies assessed the effectiveness of oral fluoride supplementation; the USPSTF found no new studies since its previous 2004 review. Although the studies had some methodological limitations, such as lack of adjustment for potential confounders, inadequate blinding, or unreported attrition, and were fairly heterogeneous, they support the conclusion that oral fluoride supplementation leads to decreased dental caries in children age 5 years and younger who have inadequate fluoridation in their water. The single randomized trial (n=140; fluoridation level &lt;0.1 ppm F) found that 0.25 mg fluoride drops or chews were associated with decreased risk for caries versus no fluoride supplementation in Taiwanese children age 2 years at enrollment. Relative reductions ranged from 52% to 72% for decayed, missing, and filled teeth and from 51% to 81% for decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces. Across all six trials, relative reductions with fluoride supplementation ranged from 32% to 72% for decayed, missing, and filled teeth and from 38% to 81% for decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces versus placebo (vitamin drops) or no supplementation.\r\n<h4>Fluoride Varnish</h4>\r\nThree recent good- and fair-quality trials assessed professionally applied topical fluoride varnish in children age 5 years and younger. The trials compared fluoride varnish applied every 6 months with no fluoride varnish. One was conducted in rural Canadian Native populations without water fluoridation and another was conducted in an Australian aboriginal community with water fluoridation levels of less than 0.6 ppm F for nearly 90% of participants. The third trial enrolled primarily Latino and Chinese underserved children in an urban U.S. community with adequate water fluoridation. All three trials found that fluoride varnish was associated with a decreased risk for dental caries after 2 years. Absolute mean reductions in the number of affected tooth surfaces ranged from 1.0 to 2.4. <br><br>Three fair-quality studies evaluated the effect of frequency of fluoride varnish application on caries outcomes. Two found that multiple fluoride varnish applications within a 2 week period were associated with no statistically significant differences in caries incidence versus a 6 month application schedule. One trial found no statistically significant difference in caries rates for once versus twice yearly varnish application. The optimum frequency of fluoride varnish application is not known.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Screening</h3>\r\nNo studies examined the effectiveness of routine oral screening examinations performed by primary care clinicians in preventing dental caries.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF considered a recently updated systematic review on enamel fluorosis that includes five new studies that were not available for the 2004 recommendation. These observational studies consistently found an association between early childhood exposure to systemic fluoride and enamel fluorosis. The evidence is limited in that measures of early childhood fluoride exposure were based on parental recall. Risk estimates ranged from an odds ratio of 10.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 62) for exposure during the first 2 years of life to a slight increase in risk (odds ratio, 1.1 to 1.7, depending on comparison). Fluorosis can range from mild (small white spots or streaks) to severe (discoloration, pitting, or brown staining), depending on the overall systemic fluoride exposure level over time. In the United States, the prevalence of severe enamel fluorosis is estimated at less than 1%.<br><br>No studies reported the risk for fluorosis with fluoride varnish application; however, the degree of systemic fluoride exposure following varnish application is low.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\nNo studies compared harms in children who were receiving routine oral screening examinations versus those not screened for dental caries by primary care providers.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to prescribing oral fluoride supplementation at recommended doses starting at age 6 months to children with inadequate fluoride in their water.<br><br>There is also moderate net benefit to applying fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all infants and children starting at the age of primary tooth eruption. <br><br>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of routine caries screening examinations performed by primary care providers to improve outcomes in children age 5 years and younger. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence regarding the potential harms. <br><br>Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of routine caries screening examinations performed by primary care providers in children age 5 years and younger is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nSystemic fluoride becomes incorporated into tooth structures during their formation. If fluoride is ingested repeatedly during tooth development, it is deposited throughout the tooth surface and provides protection against caries. Topical fluoride treatments, such as varnishes, help protect teeth that are already present. In this method, fluoride is incorporated into the surface layer of the teeth, making them more resistant to decay. Systemic fluoride also provides some measure of topical effects, as it is found in the saliva and bathes the teeth. Thus, providing both systemic and topical fluoride to children during tooth development fits with the biologic understanding of fluoride's protective actions against dental decay.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 21 May to 20 June 2013. All comments received were reviewed during the creation of the final recommendation statement. Based on public feedback, the USPSTF separated its recommendation on fluoride supplementation and the application of fluoride varnish into two parts to increase clarity surrounding the relevant populations for each intervention. The USPSTF expanded its rationale for why it recommends fluoride varnish for all infants and children once their primary teeth have erupted, rather than only those deemed to be at &ldquo;high&rdquo; risk, and why it believes that the available evidence was sufficient to make this recommendation for nondental primary care providers. The USPSTF added language concerning potential implementation issues for the use of fluoride varnish by primary care professionals. The USPSTF also clarified the definitions of &ldquo;primary care provider,&rdquo; &ldquo;dental practitioner,&rdquo; and &ldquo;inadequate water fluoridation.&rdquo; Finally, the USPSTF included an explanation of the target age range for this recommendation and provided additional details on enamel fluorosis. &nbsp;<a name=\"update\"></a>\r\n<h2>Update of Previous Recommendation</h2>\r\nThis is an update of the 2004 USPSTF recommendation statement, in which the USPSTF recommended that primary care clinicians prescribe oral fluoride supplementation to children age 6 months and older whose primary water source is deficient in fluoride (B recommendation). This recommendation was based on fair evidence that prescription of oral fluoride supplements by primary care clinicians to young children with low fluoride exposure is associated with reduced risk for dental caries that outweighs the potential harms of enamel fluorosis, which primarily manifests in the United States as mild cosmetic discoloration of the teeth. <br><br>The current statement similarly recommends oral fluoride supplementation, but expands to include the recommendation that primary care providers apply fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all children age 5 years and younger starting at tooth eruption. <br><br>In 2004, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against routine risk assessment by primary care clinicians of children age 5 years and younger for the prevention of dental disease (I statement). The current recommendation concludes that there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine oral screening examinations for dental caries performed by primary care clinicians in children age 5 years and younger.",

      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adolescents, adults, and older adults in the general U.S. population who do have an identified psychiatric disorder.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nIn 2010, suicide accounted for more than 1.4 million years of potential life lost before age 85 years, or 4.3% of total years of potential life lost in the United States. Past studies estimated that 38% of adults (50% to 70% of older adults) visited their primary care provider within 1 month of dying by suicide. Nearly 90% of suicidal youths were seen in primary care during the previous 12 months.<br><br>Given that most persons who die by suicide have a psychiatric disorder and many have been seen recently in primary care, primary care clinicians should be aware of psychiatric problems in their patients and should consider asking these patients about suicidal ideation and referring them for psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or case management. The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians screen adolescents and adults for depression when appropriate systems are in place to ensure adequate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Primary care clinicians should also focus on patients during periods of high suicide risk, such as immediately after discharge from a psychiatric hospital or after an emergency department visit for deliberate self-harm. Recent evidence suggests that interventions during these high-risk periods are effective in reducing suicide deaths.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nEvidence on the potential harms of screening for suicide risk is insufficient.\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\nThe monetary cost of screening for suicide risk is minimal. Additional time would be needed in the primary care visit to accommodate screening.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nIn a study of U.S. primary care providers, suicide was discussed in 11% of encounters with patients who had (unbeknown to their providers) screened positive for suicidal ideation. Similarly, 36% of U.S. primary care physicians explored suicide in encounters with standardized patients presenting with major depression or adjustment disorder or those who sought antidepressants. Less than one quarter of surveyed primary care pediatricians or family practice physicians in Maryland reported that they frequently or always screened adolescents for suicide risk factors.\r\n<h3>Risk Factors for Suicide</h3>\r\nAlthough evidence to determine whether the general asymptomatic population should be screened for suicide risk is inadequate, providers should consider identifying patients with risk factors or those who seem to have high levels of emotional distress and referring them for further evaluation.<br><br>Suicide risk varies by age, sex, and race or ethnicity. In men, the greatest increases in suicide rate were in those aged 50 to 54 years (49.4% [from 20.6 to 30.7 deaths per 100,000]) and those aged 55 to 59 years (47.8% [from 20.3 to 30.0 deaths per 100,000]). In women, the suicide rate increased with age, and the largest percentage increase was in those aged 60 to 64 years (59.7% [from 4.4 to 7.0 deaths per 100,000]). <br><br>American Indians and Alaskan natives aged 14 to 65 years and non-Hispanic white persons older than 18 years have higher-than-average rates of suicide death, and the risk among non-Hispanic white persons continues to increase after age 75 years. The highest rates are seen in American Indians and Alaskan natives aged 19 to 24 years and non-Hispanic white persons older than 75 years. Among adolescents, Hispanic females are at especially high risk for attempting suicide. <br><br>The greatest increases in suicide rate from 1999 to 2010 by racial or ethnic population in men and women overall were among American Indians and Alaskan natives (65.2%) and white persons (40.4%). Among American Indians and Alaskan natives, the suicide rate in women increased by 81.4% (from 5.7 to 10.3 deaths per 100,000) and the rate in men increased by 59.5% (from 17.0 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000). Among white persons, the rate in women increased by 41.9% (from 7.4 to 10.5 deaths per 100,000) and the rate in men increased by 39.6% (from 24.5 to 34.2 deaths per 100,000). <br><br>Increased risk is also associated with the presence of a mental health disorder, such as depression, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. About 87% of patients who die by suicide meet the criteria for 1 or more mental health disorders. A lifetime history of depression more than doubles the odds of a suicide attempt in U.S. adults, and depression is probably present in 50% to 79% of youths attempting suicide, although it may not always be recognized. <br><br>Other important risk factors for suicide attempt include serious adverse childhood events; family history of suicide; prejudice or discrimination associated with being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; access to lethal means; and possibly a history of being bullied, sleep disturbances, and such chronic medical conditions as epilepsy and chronic pain. In males, socioeconomic factors, such as low income, occupation, and unemployment, are also related to suicide risk. <br><br>In older adults, additional risk factors, such as social isolation, spousal bereavement, neurosis, affective disorders, physical illness, and functional impairment, increase the risk for suicide. Risk factors of special importance to military veterans include traumatic brain injury, separation from service within the past 12 months, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental health conditions. <br><br>Individual risk factors have limited ability to predict suicide in an individual at a particular time. A large proportion of Americans have 1 of these risk factors; however, only a small proportion will attempt suicide, and even fewer will die by it.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe reviewed studies used various screening tools. One example is the Suicide Risk Screen, a 20-item screening instrument embedded in a broader self-report questionnaire administered in high schools to youths at risk for dropping out of school. Another tool consists of 3 suicide-related items (&ldquo;thoughts of death,&rdquo; &ldquo;wishing you were dead,&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling suicidal&rdquo; within the past month) targeting primary care patients aged 18 to 70 years with scheduled appointments.<br><br>Sensitivity and specificity of screening tools generally ranged from 52% to 100% and from 60% to 98%, respectively. The instruments showed a wide range in accuracy, but data were limited and no instruments were examined in more than 1 study.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nMost effective treatments to reduce risk for suicide attempt include psychotherapy. The most commonly studied psychotherapy intervention was cognitive behavioral therapy and related approaches, including dialectical behavior therapy, problem-solving therapy, and developmental group therapy. Other approaches included psychodynamic or interpersonal therapy. Although most of these treatments are not customarily administered by primary care providers in the office, patients can be referred to behavioral health providers for them. The primary care provider can play a continued role in the care of these patients by monitoring them during the process, providing follow-up, and coordinating with other care providers.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nIn addition to approaching the problem of suicide from an individual level in primary care, approaches are being implemented at community, regional, and national levels. In the health care system, laws requiring coverage parity between mental and physical health disorders will give more persons the ability to access care for psychiatric problems associated with suicide, such as depression. Efforts to coordinate care among programs that address mental health, substance use, and physical health can also increase access to care. Activities that have been shown to be correlated with lower suicide rates in other countries include detoxification of domestic gas in the United Kingdom and discontinuation of the use of highly toxic pesticides in Sri Lanka. These actions were associated with 19-33% and 50% reductions in suicide, respectively, providing evidence that engineering controls can be effective. Such activities as installing barriers at frequent suicide jump spots may also be effective.<br><br>On an individual level, patients with a history of suicide attempt or suicidal ideation should not have easy access to means that may be used in suicide attempts, such as firearms or other weapons, household chemicals or poisons, or materials that can be used for hanging or suffocation.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends that physicians screen adolescents and adults for depression when appropriate systems are in place to ensure adequate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up (available at <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). <br><br>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has related recommendations on collaborative care approaches to managing depression, mental health parity policy, and home-based depression care for older adults (available at <a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/mentalhealth/index.html\">www.thecommunityguide.org/mentalhealth/index.html</a>). <br><br>In 2012, the U.S. Surgeon General and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention released the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, which includes goals and objectives for action (available at <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/national-strategy-suicide-prevention/full-report.pdf\">www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/national-strategy-suicide-prevention/full-report.pdf</a>). <br><br>The Suicide Prevention Resource Center, supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, offers various resources on suicide prevention (available at <a href=\"http://www.sprc.org/\">www.sprc.org</a>).&nbsp;<br>\r\n<h2><br>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nMore research on the epidemiology and natural history of suicide risk is needed. Persons who attempt suicide and survive and those who die by suicide are overlapping populations. Some individuals die on their first attempt and may never be seen in primary care, whereas others may repeat nonfatal attempts and never die or die after multiple attempts. More research to understand these subgroups and to determine who accesses primary care is needed. <br><br>Several key areas need further research to improve the evidence base for screening for suicide risk in primary care. For screening to be effective, more information on the performance characteristics of screening tests, particularly in average-risk adolescents,n is needed. More information is needed to determine whether more individuals with screen-detected suicidal ideation could be helped before they act. Studies examining the benefits and potential harms of targeted versus general screening would also be helpful. The possibility of incorporating technology into large-scale screening studies should also be explored. <br><br>Treatment studies in populations with screen-detected suicide risk in all age groups are needed. Targeting persons at high risk, such as American Indians and Hispanic persons, may help determine whether tailored therapies are more effective in these populations. It is critical that more investigations on the benefits and risks of interventions targeting average- and high-risk adolescents be conducted. Trials including interventions aimed at parents have shown some promise and should be further explored. <br><br>It would also be valuable to replicate trials in adults that focus primarily on the process of care (including quality of care and patient adherence) rather than the specific content of treatment sessions because trials on the latter have shown moderate-sized but statistically nonsignificant effects. <br><br>Investigating ways to link clinical and community resources might also lead to other possible methods to help patients at risk for suicide.",

      "other": "Several groups have made recommendations or commented on screening patients for suicide risk. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends that clinicians be aware of patients at high risk for suicide. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians ask questions about mood disorders, sexual orientation, suicidal thoughts, and other risk factors associated with suicide during routine health care visits. The American Medical Association states that all adolescents should be asked annually about behaviors or emotions that indicate recurrent or severe depression or risk for suicide and that physicians should screen for depression or suicidal risk in those with risk factors, such as family dysfunction, declining school grades, and history of abuse. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all adolescents be screened annually for emotions and behaviors that indicate recurrent or severe depression and thoughts of killing or harming themselves. In addition, suicide risk and depressive symptoms are included as part of the College's annual well-woman visit evaluation and counseling recommendations for females aged 13 to 65 years or older. The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in adolescents, adults, and older adults in primary care. The recommendation of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care also mirrors the 2004 USPSTF recommendation in that it found poor evidence to include or exclude routine evaluation of suicide risk during a periodic health examination.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nIn 2010, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death among all age groups in the United States, leading to almost 37,000 deaths at a rate of 11.8 deaths per 100,000 persons. Although suicide rates in the United States remained steady from 1990 through the early 2000s, they have generally been increasing over the past decade, particularly between 2005 and 2009. Suicide is among the 5 leading causes of death in children, adolescents, and adults aged 10 to 54 years.In 2011, 7.8% of high school students reported attempting suicide at least once during the previous 12 months, and 2.4% of students made a suicide attempt that required treatment due to self-injury. In the same year, an estimated 3.7% of adults aged 18 years or older reported having serious thoughts of suicide during the past year, and 0.5% attempted suicide.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nIn 2004, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening by primary care clinicians to detect suicide risk in the general population and issued an I statement, given that there was no evidence at the time that screening for suicide risk reduced suicide attempts or mortality. The USPSTF noted that there was limited evidence on the accuracy of screening tools to identify suicide risk in the primary care setting, including tools to identify high-risk persons. The USPSTF also found insufficient evidence that treatment of high-risk persons reduces suicide attempts or mortality. The USPSTF found no studies that directly addressed the harms of screening and treatment for suicide risk. As a result, the USPSTF could not determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in primary care.In updating the 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy and reliability of instruments used to screen for increased suicide risk, benefits and harms of screening for increased suicide risk, and benefits and harms of treatment to prevent suicide.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF reviewed 4 studies that evaluated the accuracy of screening instruments to identify persons at increased risk for suicide. Of these, 2 were conducted in adolescent populations that were considered to be at increased risk. One was conducted in an outpatient mental health setting in patients who had a prior diagnosis of depression. The second was conducted in a school setting and consisted of a questionnaire administered by research staff to students at risk for school dropout. An additional study involved primary care patients aged 65 years or older, and the final study involved primary care patients aged 18 to 70 years.Each study used a different tool to screen patients for increased suicide risk. All 4 studies were considered to be fair-quality. A strength of these studies was that they each applied the same reference standard to all screened participants and recruited the sample from a single identified population. However, as mentioned previously, neither of the studies of adolescents was conducted in a primary care setting and both recruited participants who were already at increased risk for suicide. Only 1 of the 4 studies reported that the reference test was independent of the screening test. An additional concern was the lag time between the screening and reference tests, with only 1 study conducting both within 24 hours of each other. Lag times for other studies ranged from 0 to 35 days or were not reported.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found no direct evidence that screening for suicide risk is associated with improved health outcomes in asymptomatic adolescents or adults. Although studies evaluating screening were more likely to be conducted in a primary care population, studies assessing the effectiveness of treatment were predominantly conducted in patients known to be at high risk. In particular, many treatment studies were of patients with previous suicide attempts or a history of mental illness, such as borderline personality disorder or depression. The proportion of patients in control groups with a history of suicide attempts in treatment studies ranged from 11% to 68%, evidence that the study populations were at high risk for suicide.Three broad treatment approaches to suicide prevention have been evaluated: psychotherapy, enhanced usual care (approaches designed to improve the quality or format of recommended treatment or improve patient adherence to usual care), and medications. Of these, psychotherapy providing specific treatment approaches showed better outcomes than enhanced usual care; few studies addressed medications. Suicide attempts were reduced by a pooled average of 32% in 11 psychotherapy trials in adults. Interventions that focused on enhancing usual care showed little effect on suicide deaths, suicide attempts, or related outcomes. A single large trial of older primary care patients reported a 20% reduction in the relative risk for a combined outcome of suicide attempts and ideation; however, the study involved education and training of a volunteer sample of general practitioners, who may have been more motivated to improve their practice than a random sample of general practitioners.Minimal data are available on the effectiveness of using medications to prevent suicidal behavior. The lone study was a short-term, fair-quality trial that assessed the use of lithium. The study reported hazard ratios that suggested a possible benefit for suicide attempts but were not statistically significant. There was a statistically significantly lower rate of suicide deaths per patient-year in the intervention group; however, the study had high attrition rates and there were only 3 suicide deaths.The evidence base for treatment interventions in adolescents is limited. Study populations primarily consisted of participants at high risk for suicide, most with recent suicide attempts or acute suicidal ideation. The effect of treatment to prevent suicide on suicide deaths could not be determined because there was only 1 death in any of the 3 trials that reported this outcome. Suicide attempts were not reduced with psychotherapy treatment at 6 to 18 months. The CI for the pooled effect was wide and crossed zero, ranging from a 25% reduction in risk to a 31% increase. Therefore, the possibility of harm or benefit cannot be ruled out with the existing evidence from psychotherapy trials.The sole enhanced usual care study in adolescents also had a sample of high-risk patients, all of whom had a history of suicide attempts, threats, or ideation. Although the study was rated fair-quality, the groups were not entirely comparable at baseline and retention varied. The study did not find any differences between the groups in suicidal ideation, depression, or hopelessness at the 12-month follow-up, thus providing no evidence of treatment benefit.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\nThree studies reported on the potential adverse effects of screening. One was a trial of adults with depression in 4 primary care practices in the United Kingdom. The other 2 were conducted in high school settings. In the study of adults, no statistically significant increases in suicide attempts or ideation were seen at 2 weeks after screening. The trial, however, had a relatively small sample (<em>n</em> = 443) and limited power. In addition, differential ascertainment may have biased the results; a higher proportion of participants who were screened withdrew consent for follow-up (6.6% of screened vs. 2.2% of unscreened). In both of the high school studies, students were randomly assigned to screening for suicide risk on 1 of 2 occasions 1 to 2 days apart. The items used to screen for suicide risk were embedded in an instrument that addressed broader mental health issues. The larger trial (<em>n</em> = 2342), conducted in 6 high schools in New York, randomly assigned the students at the classroom level. No immediate increase in students reporting suicidal ideation or mean suicidal ideation score was reported. The second study, conducted in Australia, was smaller (<em>n</em> = 308) and found no differences between the 2 groups in anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, or tension based on Profile of Mood States scores immediately after screening for suicide risk or completion of other mental health items. &ldquo;Vigor&rdquo; was the only characteristic that was reported to be higher in screened participants. After both groups had completed the suicide risk screening items, 8.9% reported that the suicide-related items were &ldquo;moderately distressing&rdquo; or &ldquo;very distressing&rdquo; and 31.5% found them to be &ldquo;a little distressing.&rdquo;Because of the paucity of data and study limitations, the possibility of short-term harms from participation in suicide screening cannot be dismissed, although no serious adverse events were documented in the studies. Other potential harms of screening include harms that may result from treatment in persons with screen-detected risk after referral.Few treatment trials in adults reported adverse events. One cognitive behavioral therapy trial reported that none of the suicide attempts was believed to be a result of study participation. In a study of a video-based problem-solving intervention, none of the participants withdrew because of worsening symptoms. A study of writing as a means for reducing suicidal ideation reported that 3 participants asked to speak with a supervisor because they became upset after writing or their writing reflected current suicidal ideation. Not enough data were available to draw conclusions on whether harms occurred due to screening in adults.Of the 11 adolescent psychotherapy treatment trials reporting suicide attempts, 4 noted non&ndash;statistically significant increases in suicide attempts, ranging from 22% to 113%. One was a small trial that had few events and wide CIs associated with the effect; however, the other trials probably had enough events to represent stable but still statistically nonsignificant effects. Thus, the possibility of harm due to treatment cannot be ruled out in currently or recently suicidal adolescents receiving therapy.In the medication trial that evaluated treatment with lithium, a higher percentage of participants in the treatment group than in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of adverse events (13% vs. 2%), although the statistical significance was not reported and overall dropout rates were similar between the groups.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for suicide risk, the effectiveness of treatment, and the harms of screening or treatment. In attempting to build a chain of indirect evidence from screening to treatment to beneficial health outcomes, the link between screening and treatment is problematic because of the poor fit between the populations in the 2 bodies of evidence. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening is lacking for adolescents, adults, and older adults.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 23 April to 21 May 2013. Most comments generally agreed with the recommendation statement. However, many requested clarification about whether it applies only to primary care settings. Several comments expressed concern that primary care providers would interpret the I statement as a statement against screening for suicide risk. In response to these comments, the USPSTF clarified that the recommendation applies to screening in a primary care setting, updated statistics on suicide, included additional information on risk factors, expanded the Research Needs and Gaps section, and updated the Recommendations of Others section.\r\n<h2>Update of Previous Recommendation</h2>\r\nIn 2004, the USPSTF concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening by primary care clinicians to detect suicide risk in the general population (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/gradespre.htm#irec\">I statement</a>). After reviewing new data from studies conducted since the last review, the USPSTF again concludes that there is insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk.",

An estimated 15% to 25% of persons with chronic HBV infection die of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.

The risk for HBV infection varies substantially by country of origin in foreign-born persons in the United States. Persons born in countries with a prevalence of HBV infection of 2% or greater account for 47% to 95% of those with chronic HBV infection in the United States (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#tab1\">Table 1</a>). Another important risk factor for HBV infection is lack of vaccination in infancy in U.S.-born persons with parents from a country or region with high prevalence (&ge;8%), such as sub-Saharan Africa, central and southeast Asia, and China (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrsfig.htm\">Figure</a>). Because HBV infection prevalence may gradually change over time, it is important to note that some countries and regions with prevalence rates between 5-7% are considered to be highly endemic areas. <br><br><strong>Table 1.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses a prevalence threshold of 2% or greater to define countries with high risk for HBV infection. Because this threshold is substantially higher than the estimated prevalence of HBV infection in the general U.S. population (0.3% to 0.5%), it is a reasonable threshold for deciding to screen a patient population or risk group. Additional risk groups for HBV infection with a prevalence of 2% or greater that should be screened include HIV-positive persons, injection drug users, household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection, and men who have sex with men (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#tab2\">Table 2</a>).<br><br><strong>Table 2.

However, reliable information about combinations of risk factors is not available. Clinicians should exercise their judgment in deciding whether these persons are at sufficiently high risk to warrant screening. For example, screening is probably appropriate in settings that treat a large proportion of persons at increased risk, such as clinics for sexually transmitted infections; HIV testing and treatment centers; health care settings that provide services for injection drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; and institutions that serve populations from countries with a high prevalence of infection, including community health centers. <br><br>The prevalence of HBV infection is low in the general U.S. population, and most infected persons do not develop complications. Therefore, screening is not recommended in those who are not at increased risk. The USPSTF notes that high rates of HBV infection have been found in cities and other areas with high numbers of immigrants or migrant persons from Asia or the Pacific Islands or their adult children. Providers should consider the population they serve when making screening decisions.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe CDC recommends screening for HBsAg with tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, followed by a licensed, neutralizing confirmatory test for initially reactive results. Immunoassays for detecting HBsAg have a reported sensitivity and specificity greater than 98%. A positive HBsAg result indicates acute or chronic infection. <br><br>Testing for antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is also done as part of a screening panel to help distinguish between infection and immunity. Acute HBV infection (acquired within 6 months after infection) is characterized by the appearance of HBsAg and followed by the appearance of IgM anti-HBc. The disappearance of HBsAg and the presence of anti-HBs and anti-HBc indicate the resolution of HBV infection and natural immunity. Anti-HBc, which persist for life, are present only after HBV infection and do not develop in persons whose immunity to HBV is due to vaccination.<br><br>Persons who have received HBV vaccination have only anti-HBs. Diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is characterized by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months. Levels of HBV DNA can fluctuate and are not a reliable marker of chronic infection.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Antiviral Regimens</h4>\r\nThe goals of antiviral treatment are to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease to prevent cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferons or nucleoside or nucleotide analogues are used to treat HBV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 7 antiviral drugs for treatment of chronic HBV infection: interferon-&alpha;2b, pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. Approved first-line treatments are pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a, entecavir, and tenofovir. Combination therapies have been evaluated but are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are generally not used as first-line treatment because tolerability, efficacy, and rates of resistance are low.&nbsp; <br><br>Several factors affect the choice of antiviral drug, including patient characteristics, HBV DNA and serum aminotransferase levels, and HBeAg status. Biopsy is sometimes done to determine the extent of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Surrogate end points of antiviral treatment include loss of HBeAg and HBsAg, HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients, and suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels by polymerase chain reaction in patients who are HBeAg-negative and anti-HBe&ndash;positive. Duration of treatment varies depending on the time required to suppress HBV DNA levels and normalize alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels; HBeAg status; the presence of cirrhosis; and the choice of drug.\r\n<h4>Vaccination</h4>\r\nThe current U.S. strategy to eliminate HBV transmission includes universal vaccination of all infants at birth and vaccination of adolescents and high-risk adults, such as injection drug users and household contacts of patients with HBV infection. Three doses of HBV vaccine result in a protective antibody response of greater than 90% in adults and greater than 95% in adolescents. The CDC recommends that susceptible persons who are screened for HBV infection may, if indicated, receive the first dose of the HBV vaccine at the same medical visit.\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\nPeriodic screening may be useful in patients with ongoing risk for HBV transmission (for example, active injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and patients receiving hemodialysis) who do not receive vaccination. Clinical judgment should determine screening frequency, because the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine specific screening intervals.<a name=\"other\"></a>\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nThe development and validation of clinical decision support or other tools to help clinicians efficiently and accurately identify populations at high risk for HBV infection, including combinations of risk factors, are needed. Available clinical trials largely report intermediate or surrogate outcomes and are relatively short. Clinical trials of adequate duration and power to evaluate long-term health outcomes (for example, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, disease-specific mortality, quality of life, and all-cause mortality) are needed. In the absence of such randomized, controlled trials, registries to assess treatment efficacy are also needed.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nFor the USPSTF recommendation on screening for HBV infection in pregnancy, go to <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspshepbpg.htm\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspshepbpg.htm</a>.

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nThe epidemiology of HBV infection has been evolving in the United States, probably because of implementation of vaccination programs beginning in 1991. The number of reported acute symptomatic cases of HBV infection decreased from more than 20,000 annually in the mid-1980s to 2,890 in 2011. However, the actual estimated number of new cases in the United States (approximately 19,000) is approximately 6.5 times the number of reported cases because of underreporting. Persons more likely to have acute HBV infection are those aged 30 to 39 years (2.33 cases per 100,000 in 2010), men, and black persons. <br><br>The burden of HBV infection disproportionately affects foreign-born persons from countries with a high prevalence of infection and their unvaccinated offspring, HIV-positive persons, men who have sex with men, and injection drug users (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#tab2\">Table 2</a>). An estimated 700,000 to 2.2 million persons in the United States have chronic HBV infection. Persons born in regions with a prevalence of HBV infection of 2% or greater, such as countries in Africa and Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of South America, account for 47% to 95% of chronically infected persons in the United States.<br><br>The death rate of HBV infection in the United States in 2010 was an estimated 0.5 per 100,000 persons. The highest death rates occurred in persons aged 55 to 64 years; men; and nonwhite, nonblack persons. Compared with non&ndash;HBV-related deaths, HBV-associated mortality is approximately 11 times higher among persons of non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander descent.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThis is an update of the 2004 USPSTF recommendation on screening for chronic HBV infection in asymptomatic, nonpregnant persons in the general population. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review with a focus on evidence gaps identified in the previous USPSTF recommendation and new studies published since 2004. New key questions focused on the benefits and harms of antiviral treatment, the benefits of education or behavior change counseling, and the association between improvements in intermediate and clinical outcomes after antiviral therapy. Key questions related to the immunization of children were excluded.<br><br>In 2009, the USPSTF published a reaffirmation of its 2004 recommendation on screening for HBV infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit (A recommendation). The USPSTF will update its recommendation on prenatal screening in the future; therefore, it is not a focus of this recommendation.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Tests</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF previously reviewed serologic testing for HBV and found it to be accurate (sensitivity and specificity &gt;98%).\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo randomized, controlled trials compared screening with no screening to provide direct evidence of the benefit of screening. No trials examined the effectiveness of education or behavior change counseling in patients with chronic HBV infection for reducing transmission or improving health outcomes. <br><br>Evidence on screening strategies for identifying persons with HBV infection is limited to 1 fair-quality, cross-sectional study (<em>n</em>= 6,194) done in France in a clinic for sexually transmitted infections. It found that a screening strategy for HBV infection that focused on testing persons born in countries with a higher prevalence of infection missed approximately two thirds of those with HBV infection (sensitivity, 31%; number needed to screen, 16). An alternative screening strategy that tested men and unemployed persons identified 98% (48 of 49) of patients with HBV infection after screening approximately two thirds of the population (number needed to screen, 82). Well-established risk factors, such as injection drug use and high-risk sexual behaviors, were not predictive. Applicability of this study to U.S. primary care settings may be limited.\r\n<h4>Intermediate Outcomes</h4>\r\nTwenty-two placebo-controlled trials (<em>n</em> = 35 to 515; duration, 8 weeks to 3 years) of antiviral therapy reported intermediate outcomes (for example, histologic improvement, HBeAg or HBsAg loss or seroconversion, or virologic response). Two trials were rated as good quality; most of the remaining trials were rated as fair quality. Methodological issues in the other trials included unclear or inadequate methods of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. <br><br>Nine trials were done in the United States or Europe. Fifteen trials enrolled patients who were entirely or largely HBeAg-positive. Trials evaluated adefovir (4 trials), interferon-&alpha;2b (8 trials), lamivudine (9 trials), and tenofovir (1 trial). Trials reported baseline rates of prevalence of cirrhosis between 5% and 44%. <br><br>Pooled estimates showed that antiviral therapy was statistically significantly more effective than placebo or no treatment in achieving histologic improvement (7 trials; risk ratio [RR], 2.1 [95% CI, 1.8 to 2.6]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%), loss or seroconversion of HBeAg (10 trials; RR, 2.1 [CI, 1.6 to 2.9]; <em>I</em>2 = 4%) and HBsAg (11 trials; RR, 2.4 [CI, 1.2 to 4.9]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%), virologic response (9 trials; RR, 7.2 [CI, 3.2 to 16]; <em>I</em>2 = 58%), and normalization of ALT levels (12 trials; RR, 2.5 [CI, 2.1 to 3.0]; <em>I</em>2= 27%). Results remained consistent when stratified by individual drug and in sensitivity and subgroup analyses based on outcomes, study quality, duration of treatment, and HBeAg-positive status. Evidence on the first-line drugs pegylated interferon, entecavir, and tenofovir is limited. <br><br>Eight fair- to good-quality trials (<em>n</em> = 42 to 638; duration, 48 to 96 weeks) compared first-line antiviral drugs with lamivudine or adefovir. Entecavir (4 trials) and pegylated interferon (2 trials) were associated with an increased likelihood of favorable intermediate outcomes (virologic and histologic improvement) compared with lamivudine. Analyses were limited by small numbers of trials. Entecavir was associated with an increased likelihood of virologic (4 trials; RR, 1.6 [CI, 1.1 to 2.5]; <em>I</em>2 = 94%) and histologic (2 trials; RR, 1.2 [CI, 1.1 to 1.3]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%) improvements compared with lamivudine. Compared with lamivudine, pegylated interferon-&alpha;2b was associated with an increased likelihood of loss or seroconversion of HBeAg (1 trial; RR, 1.6 [CI, 1.2 to 2.1] and HBsAg (2 trials; RR, 16 [CI, 2.2 to 121]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%), normalization of ALT levels (2 trials; RR, 1.4 [CI, 1.2 to 1.6]; <em>I</em>2 = 0), and virologic (2 trials; RR, 2.8 [CI, 1.9 to 4.4]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%) and histologic (2 trials; RR, 1.2 [CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%) improvements. <br><br>Head-to-head trials of entecavir versus lamivudine were heterogeneous for virologic response (4 trials; RR, 1.6 [CI, 1.1 to 2.5]; <em>I</em>2 = 94%) (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#ref1\">1</a>). Estimates from all trials favored entecavir over lamivudine (RR, 1.3 to 2.1), including the 2 largest good-quality trials (RR, 2.1 [CI, 1.8 to 2.4] and 1.3 [CI, 1.2 to 1.4]). Studies comparing tenofovir with adefovir (2 trials) showed no clear differences in effect on intermediate outcomes.\r\n<h4>Clinical Outcomes</h4>\r\nEleven randomized trials (<em>n</em> = 40 to 651; duration, 10 months to 7.5 years) of antiviral therapy versus placebo or no treatment reported clinical outcomes (for example, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality). One trial was rated as good quality, and the remaining trials were rated as fair quality. Methodological issues included inadequate details about method of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. <br><br>Five trials were done in the United States or Europe. Two trials enrolled mostly HBeAg-negative patients. Trials evaluated adefovir (2 trials), interferon-&alpha;2a (2 trials), and lamivudine (4 trials). Trials reported baseline rates of prevalence of cirrhosis between 5% and 40%. Pooled estimates for incident cirrhosis (3 trials; RR, 0.70 [CI, 0.33 to 1.46]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%), hepatocellular carcinoma (5 trials; RR, 0.57 [CI, 0.32 to 1.04]; <em>I</em>2 = 2%), and mortality (5 trials; RR, 0.55 [CI, 0.18 to 1.71]; <em>I</em>2 = 43%) had trends that favored antiviral therapy over placebo but were probably underpowered for these outcomes.<br><br>The largest trial, the CALM (Cirrhosis Asian Lamivudine Multicentre) study, had a large effect on the pooled estimate for hepatocellular carcinoma. Forty-one sites across Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand participated in the trial. Eighty-five percent of patients were men, and 98% were Asian. This fair-quality study enrolled 651 patients with advanced liver disease who were randomly assigned to lamivudine or placebo. <br><br>The trial was discontinued early after a median duration of 32.4 months because it reached a prespecified stopping threshold for a composite outcome (hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bleeding gastroesophageal varices, or liver-related death). Results were adjusted for country, sex, baseline ALT levels, Child&ndash;Pugh score, and Ishak fibrosis score. Lamivudine was associated with decreased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.49 [CI, 0.25 to 0.99]), disease progression (adjusted HR, 0.45 [CI, 0.28 to 0.73]), and worsening of liver disease (adjusted HR, 0.45 [CI, 0.22 to 0.90]) than placebo. <br><br>Too few clinical events were reported in head-to-head trials of entecavir or pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a versus pegylated and nonpegylated interferon to determine effects on clinical outcomes.\r\n<h4>Association Between Intermediate and Clinical Outcomes</h4>\r\nSeven fair-quality and 3 poor-quality observational studies evaluated the link between intermediate and clinical health outcomes after antiviral therapy. These 10 observational studies (<em>n</em>= 22 to 818; follow-up, 4.0 to 9.9 years) assessed various intermediate (virologic or biochemical remission, histologic improvement, HBeAg loss, or composite intermediate outcomes) and clinical (death, hepatocellular carcinoma, or a composite clinical outcome) outcomes. The patient populations (determined by such factors as HBeAg status and prevalence of cirrhosis at baseline), and antiviral therapy administered (lamivudine vs. interferon) also varied. Methodological issues included unclear blinding status of outcome assessors and failure to report loss to follow-up and address key confounders (age, sex, fibrosis stage, HBV viral load, and HBeAg status). <br><br>Observational studies found that improvements in various intermediate outcomes were associated with improved clinical outcomes. One fair-quality study in HBeAg-negative patients found that maintenance of virologic remission (no virologic breakthrough) was associated with a reduced risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (adjusted HR, 0.10 [CI, 0.01 to 0.77]). One fair-quality study evaluated achieving virologic remission with lamivudine therapy in HBeAg-negative patients and found no significant benefit (adjusted HR, 0.77 [CI, 0.35 to 1.69]) in the reduction of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n<h4>HBV Vaccination</h4>\r\nVaccination was associated with decreased risk for HBV acquisition in health care workers (4 trials; RR, 0.5 [CI, 0.4 to 0.7]; <em>I</em>2 = 18%) on the basis of the presence of serologic markers (HBsAg or anti-HBc). Pooled analyses from 3 fair- to good-quality trials showed that vaccination was also associated with a decreased risk for HBV acquisition than placebo in men who have sex with men on the basis of HBsAg seroconversion (RR, 0.2 [CI, 0.1 to 0.4]; <em>I</em>2 = 45%) or elevated ALT levels (RR, 0.2 [CI, 0.2 to 0.3]; <em>I</em>2= 2%). Studies did not evaluate the effects of HBV vaccination on long-term clinical outcomes.\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nPooled estimates showed no statistically significant difference between antiviral therapy and placebo or no treatment in risk for serious adverse events (12 trials; RR, 0.8 [CI, 0.6 to 1.1]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%) or any adverse event (7 trials; RR, 0.96 [CI, 0.9 to 1.0]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%). Studies did show an increased risk for withdrawal due to adverse events (9 trials; RR, 4.0 [CI, 1.4 to 11]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%). Results for harms were largely consistent when stratified according to individual drugs. <br><br>Two head-to-head trials showed that pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a was associated with greater risk for serious adverse events (RR, 2.1 [CI, 1.0 to 4.5]; <em>I</em>2 = 0%), withdrawals due to adverse events (RR, 7.6 [CI, 1.1 to 52.0]; <em>I</em>2 = 38%), and any adverse event (RR, 1.7 [CI, 1.5 to 2.0]; <em>I</em>2 = 55%) than lamivudine. There were no statistically significant differences between entecavir and lamivudine or tenofovir and adefovir.No placebo-controlled trials of pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a or entecavir reported harms, and only 1 trial each of telbivudine and tenofovir reported harms data.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found adequate evidence that HBV vaccination is effective at decreasing disease acquisition. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that antiviral treatment in patients with chronic HBV infection is effective at improving intermediate outcomes (virologic or histologic improvement or clearance of HBeAg).<br><br>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that antiviral treatment results in an important improved clinical outcome (reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma) and that antiviral therapy regimens have small harms. As a result, the USPSTF concludes that the net benefit of screening for HBV infection in high-risk populations is moderate.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nAcute HBV infections are usually self-limited. Risk for chronic infection is inversely proportional to the age at acquisition. Hepatitis B virus infection becomes chronic in more than 90% of infants and approximately 25% to 50% of children aged 1 to 5 years but fewer than 5% of older children and adults. Chronic infection spontaneously resolves in 0.5% of persons annually. Hepatitis B virus infection that persists for at least 6 months is considered chronic. <br><br>Potential long-term sequelae include cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Increased viral load is associated with greater risk for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related death, and disease transmission. Approximately 15% to 25% of persons with chronic HBV infection die of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 11 February to 10 March 2014. Some comments requested clarification about risk factors, screening tests, vaccinations, and screening frequency. Others asked for a definition of &ldquo;immunosuppressed.&rdquo; <br><br>In response to these comments, the USPSTF added language about populations that are at risk in the <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#consider\">Clinical Considerations</a>&nbsp;section. The USPSTF also added language to clarify about screening tests and vaccination. Language was added to the section on research gaps. Text was added to address screening frequency and to clarify the definition of &ldquo;immunosuppressed.&rdquo;\r\n<h2>Update of the Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2>\r\nIn 2004, the USPSTF recommended against screening for chronic HBV infection in asymptomatic persons in the general population (D recommendation). The USPSTF found that screening for HBV infection in the general population did not improve long-term health outcomes, such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or mortality; the prevalence of HBV infection was low in the general population; and most infected persons did not develop chronic infection, cirrhosis, or HBV-related liver disease. The USPSTF noted limited evidence on the effectiveness of treatment interventions and on potential harms related to screening (for example, labeling and anxiety). As a result, the USPSTF concluded that the potential harms of screening for HBV infection in the general population probably exceeded the potential benefits. <br><br>In the 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF focused only on the general population. In the current recommendation, the USPSTF focused on high-risk populations as it considered new evidence on the benefits and harms of antiviral treatment, the benefits of education or behavior change counseling, and the association between improvements in intermediate and clinical outcomes after antiviral therapy. The USPSTF found new evidence that antiviral regimens improve health outcomes, reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and that HBV vaccination is effective at decreasing disease acquisition in high-risk populations.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Although asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for stroke, it causes a relatively small proportion of strokes.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The most feasible screening test for carotid artery stenosis (defined as 60% to 99% stenosis) is ultrasonography. Although adequate evidence indicates that this test has high sensitivity and specificity, in practice, ultrasonography yields many false-positive results in the general population, which has a low prevalence of carotid artery stenosis (approximately 0.5% to 1%). There are no externally validated, reliable tools that can determine who is at increased risk for carotid artery stenosis or for stroke when carotid artery stenosis is present. Adequate evidence indicates that the accuracy of screening by auscultation of the neck is poor.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>There is no direct evidence on the benefits of screening for carotid artery stenosis. Adequate evidence indicates that in selected trial participants with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed by selected surgeons reduces the absolute incidence of all strokes or perioperative death by approximately 3.5% compared with (outdated) medical management. However, this difference is probably smaller with current optimal medical management. The magnitude of these benefits would be smaller in asymptomatic persons in the general population. For the general primary care population, the magnitude of benefit is small to none. There is no evidence that identification of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis leads to any benefit from adding or increasing medication doses (beyond current standard medical therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention).</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Adequate evidence indicates that both the testing strategy for carotid artery stenosis and treatment with CEA can cause harms. Although screening with ultrasonography has few direct harms, all screening strategies, including those with or without confirmatory tests (that is, digital subtraction or magnetic resonance angiography), have imperfect sensitivity and specificity and could lead to unnecessary interventions and result in serious harms. In selected centers similar to those in the trials, CEA is associated with a 30-day stroke or mortality rate of approximately 2.4%; reported rates are as high as approximately 5% in low-volume centers and 6% in certain states. Myocardial infarctions are reported in 0.8% to 2.2% of patients after CEA. The 30-day stroke or mortality rate after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAAS) is approximately 3.1% to 3.8%. The overall magnitude of harms of screening and subsequent treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is small to moderate depending on patient population, surgeon, center volume, and geographic location.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis outweigh the benefits.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms. It was based on evidence of the benefits and harms of screening using ultrasonography to detect narrowing of the carotid arteries. A previous USPSTF review on the assessment of carotid intima&ndash;media thickness in 2009 found insufficient evidence to support its use as a screen for coronary heart disease risk. For this recommendation, the USPSTF did not review new evidence on ultrasonography to characterize carotid plaque structure or intima&ndash;media thickness and their association with cardiovascular disease events. However, clinicians considering using ultrasonography to characterize carotid plaque to stratify patient risk for cardiovascular disease should consider the same harms that the USPSTF evaluated for this recommendation (stroke, myocardial infarction, and death from CEA) because surgery may result from this screen.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nThe major risk factors for carotid artery stenosis include older age, male sex, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease. Despite evidence on important risk factors, there are no externally validated, reliable methods to determine who is at increased risk for carotid artery stenosis or for stroke when carotid artery stenosis is present.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nAlthough screening with ultrasonography has few direct harms, all screening strategies, including those with or without confirmatory tests (that is, digital subtraction or magnetic resonance angiography), have imperfect sensitivity and could lead to unnecessary surgery and result in serious harms, including death, stroke, and myocardial infarction. There is no evidence that screening by auscultation of the neck to detect carotid bruits is accurate or provides benefit.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has made recommendations on many factors related to stroke prevention, including screening for hypertension, screening for dyslipidemia, the use of nontraditional coronary heart disease risk factors, counseling on smoking, and counseling on healthful diet and physical activity. In addition, the USPSTF recommends the use of aspirin for persons at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). &nbsp;<a name=\"other\"></a>\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nValid and reliable tools are needed to determine which persons are at high risk for carotid artery stenosis or for stroke due to carotid artery stenosis and who might experience harm from treatment with CEA or CAAS. Studies comparing CEA or CAAS with current standard medical therapy are needed. The planned CREST-2 (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial 2) may provide important data for future recommendations. CREST-2 will study 2400 patients with greater than 70% stenosis who are randomly assigned to CAAS with intensive medical management versus intensive medical management alone or to CEA with intensive medical management versus intensive medical management alone.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nStroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Mortality from all strokes has decreased substantially over the past 5 decades; improved blood pressure control is believed to be the most important factor accounting for this decrease. Other factors, including treatment and control of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, are also reported to be important contributors. Most strokes are ischemic (80% to 90%), and approximately 10% to 20% are from hemorrhagic causes.<br><br>In a population-based U.S. study from 1999, the age-adjusted incidence rates for ischemic stroke subtypes were 40 per 100,000 persons for stroke due to cardioembolic causes, 27 per 100,000 persons for stroke due to atherostenosis causes, 25 per 100,000 persons for lacunar stroke (small vessel disease), and 52 per 100,000 persons for stroke due to unknown causes. Strokes resulting from large artery atherothrombotic disease (such as carotid artery stenosis) in previously asymptomatic patients (the focus of this recommendation) account for a relatively small proportion of all strokes.<br><br>The best available data from U.S.-based studies report that the overall estimated prevalence of carotid artery stenosis (defined as 70% or 75% to 99% stenosis) is 0.5% to 1%. Studies have found that the condition is more prevalent in older adults, smokers, persons with hypertension, and persons with heart disease. Evidence shows that the incidence of stroke caused by carotid artery stenosis has been decreasing. Research has not shown any single risk factor or clinically useful risk stratification tool that can reliably and accurately distinguish between persons who have clinically important carotid artery stenosis and those who do not.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nIn 2007, the USPSTF recommended against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population. To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to synthesize the evidence on the accuracy of screening tests, externally validated risk stratification tools, the benefits of treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with CEA or CAAS, the benefits from medications added to current standard medical therapy, and the harms of screening and treatment with CEA or CAAS.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThree meta-analyses and 3 primary studies assessed the accuracy or reliability of duplex ultrasonography (DUS) to detect carotid artery stenosis. A good-quality meta-analysis included studies published from 1966 to 2003 and used digital subtraction angiography as the reference standard. Authors reported a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI, 97% to 100%) and a specificity of 88% (CI, 76% to 100%) for detecting carotid artery stenosis of 50% or greater. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting carotid artery stenosis of 70% or greater were 90% (CI, 84% to 94%) and 94% (CI, 88% to 97%), respectively. This evidence is limited by the lack of reporting on whether (or what proportion of) asymptomatic patients were included.<br><br>The reliability of DUS to detect potentially clinically important carotid artery stenosis is limited. A good-quality meta-analysis reported wide variation in measurement properties between laboratories, with clinically important variation in the magnitude of the variation. Potential sources of heterogeneity of measurements include differences in patients, study designs, equipment, techniques, and methods of classification or training. One study of 1006 carotid arteries reported poor agreement between readers for the differentiation of stenoses of less than 70% (45% agreement; &kappa; = 0.26 [CI, 0.23 to 0.29]) but excellent agreement for stenoses of 70% or greater (96% agreement; &kappa; = 0.85 [CI, 0.83 to 0.87]). Results of DUS screening can also vary on the basis of the type of scanner, the velocity cut points or ratios used, the Doppler angle employed, and inherent variability between facilities and observers.<br><br>Four studies assessed the use of auscultation for carotid bruits to detect carotid artery stenosis. Reported sensitivity ranged from 46% to 77%, and specificity ranged from 71% to 98%. However, none of the studies used angiography as a gold standard, and only 2 studies involved patients from the general population.<br><br>No externally validated risk stratification tools can reliably distinguish between persons who have clinically important carotid artery stenosis and those who do not or those who will experience harm after treatment with CEA or CAAS.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nThere are no studies on the direct benefit of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Three randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the benefit of treating asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with CEA: ACAS (Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study), VACS (Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study), and ACST (Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial). These RCTs studied 5226 patients randomly assigned to treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with CEA or medical therapy alone and followed the patients for 2.7 to 9 years. Two of the studies (ACAS and VACS) were conducted in North America, and ACST was conducted in 30 countries, primarily in Europe. The mean age of patients was 65 to 68 years, and they were required to have at least 50% (VACS) or 60% (ACAS and ACST) stenosis of the carotid artery. In the 2 North American trials, most patients (87% to 95%) were white. Two thirds of the patients in ACAS and ACST and all of the patients in VACS were men.<br><br>The evidence has important limitations, including the lack of studies focusing on a population identified by screening in primary care. In addition, many of the enrolled patients were not completely asymptomatic. Although study patients were required to be recently asymptomatic for the carotid artery under study, 20% to 24% had a history of contralateral CEA and 25% to 32% had a history of contralateral transient ischemic attack or stroke in trials reporting baseline data for these characteristics. ACST allowed the enrollment of patients who had a transient ischemic attack or stroke attributable to the carotid artery under study if it occurred more than 6 months before enrollment, and ACAS included patients if their symptoms referable to the contralateral artery occurred more than 45 days before enrollment. Medical therapy varied across trials and was not clearly defined or standardized, although all patients received aspirin in ACAS and VACS. Surgeons were highly selected and were required to submit records of their 50 most recent cases (ACAS and ACST) or previous 24 months performing CEA (VACS); they were selected on the basis of demonstrated low morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, the ACAS and ACST trial protocols did not allow further enrollment of patients by surgeons or institutions that showed unacceptably high morbidity or mortality during the trial. <br><br>In general, the RCTs reported results combining stroke and death outcomes during the perioperative period 30 days after surgery and during the time subsequent to this period. Pooled estimates from the 3 RCTs found that, compared with patients receiving medical treatment alone, 2.0% fewer patients randomly assigned to CEA had perioperative stroke or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke. Pooled estimates on the outcome of death, perioperative stroke, or any subsequent stroke reported that 3.5% fewer patients treated with CEA had this outcome than those in medical treatment groups.<br><br>No studies compared CAAS with medical therapy or studied the incremental benefit of additional medications beyond current standard medical therapy.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo studies examined the direct harms of screening. Although angiography is less commonly used now as a confirmatory test, harms from it occurred in 2 of the previously discussed RCTs. In ACAS, 1.2% of patients (5 of 414) who had angiography developed strokes, and 1 of these patients died. In VACS, 0.4% of patients (3 of 714) had nonfatal strokes after angiography.<br><br>The 3 previously discussed RCTs, 8 studies based on additional trials, and 8 cohort studies provided data on harms of treatment. Four of the additional trials include the CASANOVA (Carotid Artery Stenosis with Asymptomatic Narrowing: Operation Versus Aspirin) trial, the MACE (Mayo Asymptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy) trial, CREST, and the SAPPHIRE (Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy) trial. The MACE and CASANOVA trials were conducted in the early 1990s and included 252 patients with 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, confirmed by angiography, who were randomly assigned to treatment with CEA. Patients in both trials were predominantly male (56% to 63%); most (60% to 64%) had hypertension, and 42% to 44% had coronary artery disease. Data on harms were provided by 2 other multicenter RCTs (CREST and the SAPPHIRE trial), which compared CEA with CAAS. The SAPPHIRE trial required that participants have at least 1 condition suggesting high surgical risk (for example, age older than 80 years, severe pulmonary disease, or contralateral carotid occlusion). Prevalence of hypertension in CREST and the SAPPHIRE trial was 85% to 88%, prevalence of diabetes in the trials was 25% to 33%, and prevalence of coronary artery disease was 81% in the SAPPHIRE trial and 44% in CREST. In both trials, interventionalists had to demonstrate low complication rates before participating. Eight multicenter cohort studies using Medicare claims and enrollment databases reported perioperative harms of CEA.<br><br>Pooled analysis of data from 6 trials (<em>n</em> = 3435) showed that 2.4% (CI, 1.7% to 3.1%) of patients died or had a stroke in the 30-day period after CEA, which was 1.9% more (CI, 1.2% to 2.6%) than in the medical therapy groups in the 3 trials (<em>n</em> = 5223) directly comparing CEA with medical therapy. Pooled data from cohort studies showed a 3.3% rate of death or stroke after CEA at 30 days. One cohort study on harms from CAAS, the CREST lead-in study, found a stroke or death rate of 3.8% (CI, 2.9% to 5.1%). A meta-analysis of 2 trials (<em>n</em> = 6152) found a stroke or death rate of 3.1% (CI, 2.7% to 3.6%) after CAAS.<br><br>Other important harms after surgical intervention for carotid artery stenosis include myocardial infarction and surgical complications. In ACST, myocardial infarctions occurred in 0.6% more patients in the CEA group than in the medical group. VACS reported 4 events in the CEA group and none in the medical therapy group. One cohort study of 6 New York hospitals, which included 1378 Medicare beneficiaries who received CEA for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis during 1997 to 1998, reported a 0.85% rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction. A similar 1993 study of Medicare beneficiaries in Georgia (<em>n</em> = 1002) reported a 0.8% rate of myocardial infarction and a 0.6% rate of myocardial infarction&ndash;related death. Cranial nerve injury is another important potential harm; it occurred in 3.8% of patients (8 of 211) who received CEA in VACS, but none had permanent disability. The CASANOVA trial reported such CEA complications as lung embolism (1.4%), permanent cranial nerve damage (4.2%), pneumonia (1.4%), and local hematoma requiring surgery (2.8%). The total frequency of major complications (such as death, stroke, minor stroke, myocardial infarction, and permanent cranial nerve damage) in the group randomly assigned to immediate surgery was 7.9%. The MACE trial reported a 1.1% rate of minor cranial nerve injury in the 36 patients randomly assigned to CEA.<br><br>The volume of patients treated by individual surgeons and centers is often suggested as an important factor that may affect outcomes. The USPSTF reviewed studies using Medicare data that reported the relationship between patient volume and adverse events after CEA. One study of Medicare beneficiaries who had CEA (350 procedures) during 1993 to 1994 in Oklahoma found combined 30-day stroke and death rates of 3.5% at high-volume hospitals (&gt;100 Medicare-covered CEAs performed over the study period) and 5.2% at low-volume centers. A similar study of Medicare beneficiaries who received CEA at 115 hospitals in Ohio (167 procedures) reported stroke or death rates of 0% at high-volume centers and 4.9% at low-volume centers during 1993 to 1994. A major limitation of the evidence on harms associated with CEA is the dearth of recent data: all of the observational studies reporting on 30-day perioperative harms after CEA were based on data from the 1990s.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found no evidence that screening for carotid artery stenosis leads to additional treatment and benefit beyond standard preventive treatments based on traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In patients and surgeons similar to those in the RCTs, treatment with CEA for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis can result in a net absolute reduction in stroke rates, but this benefit has only been shown in selected patients with selected surgeons and must be weighed against a small increase in nonfatal myocardial infarctions. The net benefit of CEA largely depends on patients surviving the perioperative period without complications and living for at least 5 years. The magnitude of these benefits would be smaller in asymptomatic persons in the general population than among patients in RCTs.<br><br>For the general primary care population, the magnitude of benefit is small to none. Adequate evidence indicates that both the testing strategy for carotid artery stenosis and treatment with CEA or CAAS can cause serious harms. In selected centers similar to those in the trials, CEA is associated with a 30-day stroke or mortality rate of approximately 2.4%; reported rates are as high as approximately 5% in low-volume centers and 6% in certain states. Myocardial infarctions are reported in 0.8% to 2.2% of patients after CEA. The 30-day stroke or mortality rate after CAAS is approximately 3.1% to 3.8%. The overall magnitude of harms is small to moderate depending on patient population, surgeon, center volume, and geographic location.<br><br>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis outweigh the benefits.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nThe medical treatment groups in the RCTs were poorly defined and probably did not include the intensive blood pressure and lipid control that is currently standard practice for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is difficult to determine what effect current standard medical therapy would have on comparative outcomes of medical and surgical treatments, including the potential incremental benefit of CEA.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 18 February through 17 March 2014. All comments were reviewed and considered by the USPSTF. Many commenters agreed with the draft recommendation. Several requested clarification on the focus of this recommendation; the recommendation statement was revised to clarify that, for this recommendation, the USPSTF did not review new evidence on the use of carotid artery ultrasonography to evaluate risk for cardiovascular disease. A few commenters provided citations for related medical articles, and the USPSTF reviewed these for relevance to the current recommendation.&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2>\r\nThis recommendation is an update of the 2007 recommendation on screening for carotid artery stenosis, which also concluded that the general asymptomatic adult population should not be screened for the condition.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease, primarily in the forms of heart disease and stroke, is a leading cause of death in the United States. Obesity is associated with increased CVD mortality. Adults who adhere to national guidelines for a healthful diet and physical activity&nbsp;have lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those who do not. All persons, regardless of CVD risk status, can accrue the health benefits of improved nutrition, healthy eating behaviors, and increased physical activity.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive behavioral counseling interventions have moderate benefits for CVD risk in overweight or obese adults who are at increased risk for CVD, including decreases in blood pressure, lipid and fasting glucose levels, and body mass index (BMI) and increases in levels of physical activity. The reduction in glucose levels was large enough to decrease the incidence of a diabetes diagnosis. The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence that intensive behavioral counseling interventions lead to decreases in mortality or CVD rates.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of behavioral counseling interventions are small to none. None of the dietary intervention studies explicitly reported adverse events. Studies of physical activity interventions reported mostly minor adverse events, and intense physical activity was rarely associated with cardiovascular events.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity have a moderate net benefit in overweight or obese adults who are at increased risk for CVD.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older in primary care settings who are overweight or obese and have known CVD risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome). In the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, the vast majority of participants had a BMI greater than 25 kg/m2.\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\nMost studies evaluated interventions that combined counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity and were intensive, with multiple contacts (which may have included individual or group counseling sessions) over extended periods. Interventions involved an average of 5 to 16 contacts over 9 to 12 months depending on their intensity. Most of the sessions were in-person, and many included additional telephone contacts. Interventions generally focused on behavior change, and all included didactic education plus additional support. Most included audit and feedback, problem-solving skills, and individualized care plans. Some trials also focused on medication adherence. Interventions were delivered by specially trained professionals, including dietitians or nutritionists, physiotherapists or exercise professionals, health educators, and psychologists. <br><br>Many types of intensive counseling interventions were effective. However, it was not clear how the magnitude of the effect was related to the format of the intervention (for example, face-to-face, individual, group, or telephone), the person providing the counseling, the duration of the intervention, or the number of sessions because different combinations of components were effective (see the <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#implement\">Implementation section</a>for more information on effective interventions). Because of the intensity and expertise required, most interventions were referred from primary care and delivered outside that setting.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nTobacco use continues to be one of the most important risk factors for CVD. Helping patients with tobacco cessation is a critical component of CVD prevention. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions to those who use such products. The U.S. Public Health Service has published guidelines to further help clinicians.<br><br>Multifaceted approaches with linkages between primary care practices and community resources could increase the effectiveness of interventions. Effective interactions between health care and community interventions, specifically public health and health policy interventions (such as healthy community design and built environment), can support and enhance the effectiveness of clinical interventions (more information is available at <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces\">www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces</a>). The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several community-based interventions to promote physical activity, including community-wide campaigns, social support interventions, school-based physical education, and environmental and policy approaches. It also recommends programs promoting diet and physical activity for persons who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes on the basis of strong evidence of the effectiveness of these programs in reducing the incidence of new-onset diabetes. These recommendations are available at <a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/\">www.thecommunityguide.org</a>.<br><br>The Million Hearts initiative (<a href=\"http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/\">http://millionhearts.hhs.gov</a>) aims to decrease the number of heart attacks and strokes by 1 million by 2017. It emphasizes the use of effective clinical preventive services combined with multifaceted community prevention strategies.<br><br>In 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services jointly issued the &ldquo;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&rdquo;. The latter also issued complementary physical activity guidelines.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has a wide range of recommendations focusing on CVD prevention. The current recommendation focuses on behavioral counseling that encourages healthy eating and physical activity behaviors to improve cardiovascular health. It does not address weight-loss programs. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively initiate behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity in patients who are not obese and not at increased cardiovascular risk. The USPSTF does not address behavioral counseling in patients with a BMI less than 25 kg/m2 who are at increased risk for CVD. However, for patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater, the USPSTF recommends screening these patients for obesity and offering or referring them to intensive, multicomponent behavioral counseling for weight loss.<br><br>In another recommendation, the USPSTF recommends screening for lipid disorders in adults according to age and risk factors. It also recommends screening for blood pressure in adults, screening for diabetes in patients with elevated blood pressure, and aspirin use when appropriate. These recommendations are available at <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.<br>&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF defines behavioral counseling interventions as preventive services that are designed to help persons engage in healthy behaviors and limit unhealthy ones. The USPSTF previously described the challenges of developing behavioral counseling recommendations that are feasible for primary care delivery or available for referral from primary care and delivered in other settings. Two well-researched interventions, the DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) and PREMIER, could feasibly be adapted and delivered in the primary care setting or by local community providers. These interventions are described in further detail because they can be provided by an appropriately trained counselor (typically a dietitian, nutritionist, health educator, or psychologist) and their materials are publicly available. Descriptions of all of the reviewed interventions are included in the evidence review.<br><br>The DPP focused on whether weight reduction through a healthful diet and physical activity could prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Participants in the lifestyle intervention group received intensive training in diet, physical activity, and behavior modification from a case manager or lifestyle coach. Lifestyle coaches were dietitians or persons with a master's degree and training in exercise physiology, behavioral psychology, or health education. Participants received basic information about nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral self-management. The program addressed problem solving and strategies to deal with eating at restaurants, stress, and lapses. Participants and coaches engaged in face-to-face sessions at least once every 2 months and talked by telephone at least once between visits. The DPP study documents, including coach and participant materials, are available online in English and Spanish (<a href=\"https://dppos.bsc.gwu.edu/web/dppos/lifestyle\">https://dppos.bsc.gwu.edu/web/dppos/lifestyle</a>). At least 1 trial included in the review&nbsp;used an adapted DPP lifestyle intervention in patients recruited from a primary care setting. The trial was conducted in a large multispecialty group practice. Investigators tested a coach-led intervention and a home-based, DVD-facilitated intervention, as well as a Web-based portal for goal setting and self-monitoring. The materials used for the intervention are available online from the University of Pittsburgh Diabetes Prevention Support Center (<a href=\"http://www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu/\">www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu</a>).<br><br>PREMIER tested whether counseling on comprehensive lifestyle changes could prevent or control high blood pressure. Participants in the intensive intervention group were counseled over 6 months to track their diet (including calorie and sodium consumption) and physical activity and received printed materials about blood pressure and lifestyle changes. In addition, they were taught to follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and emphasizes reduced intake of saturated and total fat. The intervention was delivered by dietitians or health educators with a master's degree. The materials from this intervention, including participant manuals, food and fitness guides, and food diaries, are available online at <a href=\"http://www.kpchr.org/research/public/premier/premier.htm\">www.kpchr.org/research/public/premier/premier.htm</a>. Information about the DASH diet is available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nTrials examining the effectiveness of less intensive counseling that can be delivered in the primary care setting, including the minimum intensity, number of interactions, and duration necessary for effectiveness, are needed, as are trials studying the duration of effect beyond 2 to 3 years of follow-up or beyond the intensive counseling intervention period. The effectiveness of interventions for physical activity alone has not been well-studied. Trials examining the interaction or potentiation of clinical counseling and community-based lifestyle interventions are needed. Finally, the lack of direct evidence of effect on CVD events is an important research gap. Advances in management of CVD risk factors and relatively low rates of CVD events in study populations present a challenge to researchers trying to assess differences in CVD outcomes.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nCardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, and well-established CVD risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, are common in adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly half of all U.S. adults aged 20 years or older have at least 1 of the following CVD risk factors: uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, or current smoking. It also estimates that nearly 70% of U.S. adults are overweight or obese.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe evidence review&nbsp;for this recommendation addressed whether primary care&ndash;relevant counseling interventions for a healthful diet and/or physical activity modify self-reported behaviors, intermediate physiologic outcomes (such as lipid levels, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, weight, and BMI), diabetes incidence, and cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in adults with known cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose or glucose intolerance, or the metabolic syndrome). The adverse effects of counseling interventions were also reviewed.<br><br>This recommendation is intended to complement the USPSTF's 2012 recommendation on behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in persons without cardiovascular risk factors (C recommendation). The evidence review did not include interventions specifically focused on weight loss, which are addressed in the USPSTF's recommendation on screening and counseling for obesity (B recommendation). Trials conducted exclusively in persons with diabetes were excluded.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF considered 74 trials (with 77 intervention groups) in its review. Interventions that combined a healthful diet and physical activity were evaluated in 49 trial groups, diet-only interventions were evaluated in 18, and interventions involving physical activity only were evaluated in 10. Of the interventions reviewed, 2 were low-intensity, 48 were medium-intensity, and 37 were high-intensity. Interventions were defined as low-, medium-, or high-intensity on the basis of the amount of interaction with a provider (&le;30, 31 to 360, and &gt;360 minutes, respectively). Interventions targeted various risk factors, including dyslipidemia (17 trials), hypertension (18 trials), impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance (16 trials), and a combination of risk factors (26 trials). A substantial majority of trial participants had a BMI greater than 25 kg/m2. The median BMI was 29.8 kg/m2 (interquartile range, 28.4 to 31.2 kg/m2).\r\n<h4>Patient Health Outcomes</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF considered 16 trials reporting effects on patient health outcomes (such as CVD events, mortality, quality of life, or depression symptoms). Five of these trials reported cardiovascular events, including mortality; of these, 4 found no reduction in CVD events or mortality at 6 to 79 months. However, CVD event rates were low. One trial, the Risk Factor Intervention Study, showed a reduction in a composite measure of CVD events at 6.6 years of follow-up (relative risk, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.92]). The trial combined counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity with medications to manage CVD risk factors in Swedish men. Participants had notably high rates of smoking, diabetes, and previous myocardial infarctions and a 21% mortality rate during the trial.<br><br>Overall, 4 trials of combined lifestyle interventions did not seem to alleviate self-reported depression symptoms in persons with impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance at 6 to 12 months. The results for self-reported quality-of-life measures were mixed. Three trials of combined lifestyle counseling showed improvement in selected measures of quality of life; however, 2 trials of combined lifestyle counseling and 2 trials involving physical activity only showed no benefit at 6 to 12 months.\r\n<h4>Intermediate Health Outcomes</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF considered 71 trials, with more than 32,000 participants, that reported intermediate health outcomes. Commonly reported intermediate outcomes included objective measures of lipid levels, blood pressure, glucose levels, weight, composite cardiovascular risk scores, medication use, and diabetes incidence. Overall, medium- to high-intensity interventions involving counseling on diet and physical activity decreased total and LDL cholesterol levels, blood pressure, fasting glucose level, diabetes incidence, and weight. Improvements were most robust at 12 to 24 months; few studies followed participants for more than 24 months.<br><br>Intensive combined lifestyle interventions reduced total cholesterol levels by 0.14 mmol/L (5.43 mg/dL) (CI, 0.07 to 0.21 mmol/L [2.89 to 7.97 mg/dL]), LDL cholesterol levels by 0.10 mmol/L (3.69 mg/dL) (CI, 0.04 to 0.15 mmol/L [1.40 to 5.98 mg/dL]), triglyceride levels by 0.09 mmol/L (8.33 mg/dL) (CI, 0.03 to 0.16 mmol/L [2.86 to 13.80 mg/dL]), systolic blood pressure by 2.06 mm Hg (CI, 1.08 to 3.03 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure by 1.30 mm Hg (CI, 0.68 to 1.93 mm Hg), fasting glucose levels by 0.10 mmol/L (1.86 mg/dL) (CI, 0.03 to 0.18 mmol/L [0.49 to 3.24 mg/dL]), weight by a standardized mean difference of 0.24 (CI, 0.14 to 0.35), and diabetes incidence by a relative risk of 0.54 (CI, 0.34 to 0.88). These effects were assessed across all trials that reported each outcome at 12 to 24 months. <br><br>Intensive diet-only interventions reduced total cholesterol levels by 0.10 mmol/L (3.75 mg/dL) (CI, 0.03 to 0.17 mmol/L [1.01 to 6.50 mg/dL]), LDL cholesterol levels by 0.11 mmol/L (4.27 mg/dL) (CI, 0.02 to 0.20 mmol/L [0.70 to 7.84 mg/dL]), and triglyceride levels by 0.20 mmol/L (17.86 mg/dL) (CI, 0.03 to 0.37 mmol/L [2.62 to 33.10 mg/dL]). Few trials that evaluated only physical activity reported intermediate outcomes, making it difficult to estimate average effects. Most of these interventions were medium-intensity, and there were important differences among populations, interventions, and outcomes. Overall, there is no consistent evidence of benefit on intermediate health outcomes for interventions involving physical activity only.\r\n<h4>Health Behavior Outcomes</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF considered 61 trials (<em>n</em> = 31,751) reporting outcomes related to health behaviors. Three of these trials reported only health behavior outcomes and not intermediate health outcomes. Overall, objectively measured and self-reported changes in dietary intake (such as decreased total and saturated fat, increased fruits and vegetables, and total calories) and physical activity were consistent with intermediate outcome findings. Several trials in persons already receiving medication to decrease blood pressure or cholesterol level reported statistically significant improvements in dietary intake and physical activity but found no benefit on intermediate outcomes.<br><br>The DPP was a good-quality, high-intensity trial of a combined behavioral counseling intervention aimed at preventing diabetes in overweight persons with impaired fasting glucose&nbsp; (see the <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#implement\">Implementation section</a> for more detail). It was one of the few trials included in the review that assessed health, intermediate, and behavioral outcomes. The trial enrolled 2161 participants in the intervention and placebo groups (mean age, 51 years). More than one quarter (26.9%) and one third (34.6%) of participants had hypertension or dyslipidemia, respectively, and the mean BMI was 34 kg/m2 (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#ref6\">6</a>). Overall, at 3 years, persons in the intervention group had a 0.22-mmol/L (4-mg/dL) decrease in fasting blood glucose level, a 58% reduction in diabetes incidence, and decreases in blood pressure and lipid measures.<br><br>PREMIER was a good-quality trial aimed at decreasing blood pressure in persons who were not yet receiving medication (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#ref13\">13</a>) (see the <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#implement\">Implementation section</a> for more detail). The trial enrolled 304 participants in the hypertension subgroup (mean age, 52 years; mean systolic blood pressure, 144 mm Hg) (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#ref6\">6</a>). Approximately two thirds of participants had a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. After 18 months, only 21% of persons in the intensive counseling intervention group versus 41% in the usual care group were receiving hypertension medication. Participants in the intervention group also had decreases in blood pressure and lipid measures after 6 months; however, the improvements generally decreased after 18 months.\r\n<h4>Summary</h4>\r\nThe evidence reviewed by the USPSTF shows the effectiveness of intensive behavioral counseling interventions in making small but important changes in health behavior outcomes and selected intermediate clinical outcomes after 12 to 24 months. Total cholesterol levels decreased by approximately 0.08 to 0.16 mmol/L (3 to 6 mg/dL), and LDL cholesterol levels decreased by approximately 0.04 to 0.13 mmol/L (1.5 to 5 mg/dL). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 1 to 3 mm Hg and 1 to 2 mm Hg, respectively. Fasting glucose levels decreased by approximately 0.06 to 0.17 mmol/L (1 to 3 mg/dL). Diabetes incidence decreased by as much as 42% in trials reporting outcomes after 3 years. Weight decreased by a standardized mean difference of 0.26, which is roughly equivalent to a BMI reduction of 0.5 to 1.5 kg/m2, or approximately 3 kg. Based on self-reported physical activity, the proportion of persons who participated in moderate-intensity exercise for 150 minutes per week increased from 10% to 25%. Epidemiologic data suggest that even small improvements in lipid levels, blood pressure, glycemic control, and weight can decrease the risk for heart disease and stroke in persons at increased risk for CVD.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\nOf the 74 trials reviewed by the USPSTF, only 6 specifically reported adverse events during the trial and 6 specifically reported no adverse events. Few trials reported details about the adverse events, but most were minor, including musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal symptoms. In trials evaluating physical activity interventions, a few participants reported fatigue, muscle soreness, or other minor musculoskeletal injuries. Serious adverse events were rare. There was no consistent evidence that behavioral counseling interventions led to paradoxical changes in intermediate or behavioral outcomes.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF assessed the overall effectiveness of intensive behavioral counseling interventions on intermediate and behavioral health outcomes to be moderate. The changes in lipid and blood pressure measures were generally small, but these effects are combined with reductions in measures of weight and sustained improvements in healthy lifestyle behaviors. The effects are consistent across a substantive body of evidence for a variety of CVD risk factors and interventions. The potential harms are at most small, leading the USPSTF to conclude that these interventions produce a moderate net benefit.<br><br>The USPSTF assessed the overall effectiveness of intensive behavioral counseling interventions on intermediate and behavioral health outcomes to be moderate. The changes in lipid and blood pressure measures were generally small, but these effects were combined with reductions in weight and sustained improvements in healthy lifestyle behaviors. The effects are consistent across a substantive body of evidence for various CVD risk factors and interventions. The USPSTF concludes that, because a substantial majority of trial participants were overweight or obese, these persons will accrue benefits from these interventions. The potential harms are small at most; therefore, the USPSTF concludes that these interventions have a moderate net benefit.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 13 May to 9 June 2014. Thirty-three comments were received. In response to these comments, the USPSTF clarified how this recommendation fits with related ones on healthy lifestyles and screening for obesity. It clarified the population under consideration throughout the recommendation statement and more explicitly defined the connections between the populations studied and the target population of the recommendation. The USPSTF also provided more detail on the evidence gap for CVD outcomes and added to the Research Needs and Gaps section. In addition, it added or updated several references and made other minor editorial changes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2>\r\nThis recommendation is an update and refinement of the USPSTF's 2003 recommendation on dietary counseling for adults with CVD risk factors (B recommendation). At that time, the USPSTF recommended intensive behavioral dietary counseling for adult patients with known CVD risk factors, including hyperlipidemia and other diet-related chronic diseases. In contrast, this new recommendation targets overweight or obese adults who have additional CVD risk factors (such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome). Interventions assessed for this recommendation focused on improving healthy eating, increasing physical activity, or combined approaches to developing a healthier lifestyle.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Preeclampsia is one of the most serious health problems affecting pregnant women. It is a complication in 2% to 8% of pregnancies worldwide and contributes to both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia also accounts for 15% of preterm births in the United States. The disorder is defined by the onset of hypertension (blood pressure &ge;140/90 mm Hg) and proteinuria (&ge;0.3 g of protein in the urine within a 24-hour period) during the second half of pregnancy (&gt;20 weeks). In the absence of proteinuria, preeclampsia is classified as hypertension with any of the following: thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or cerebral or visual disturbances.</p>\r\n<h3>Recognition of Risk Status</h3>\r\n<p>Important risk factors for preeclampsia include history of preeclampsia (including early-onset preeclampsia), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or preterm birth; placental abruption or fetal death; maternal comorbid conditions (including type 1 or 2 pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal disease, and autoimmune diseases); and multifetal gestation.Predictive models that combine risk factors to identify women at risk for preeclampsia, such as serum biomarkers, uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography, and clinical history and measures, are in development. None have yet shown sufficient accuracy for clinical use.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence of a reduction in risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, and IUGR in women at increased risk for preeclampsia who received low-dose aspirin, thus demonstrating substantial benefit.Low-dose aspirin (range, 60 to 150 mg/d) reduced the risk for preeclampsia by 24% in clinical trials and reduced the risk for preterm birth by 14% and IUGR by 20%.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that low-dose aspirin as preventive medication does not increase the risk for placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, or fetal intracranial bleeding. In a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of women at low/average or increased risk for preeclampsia, there was no significantly increased risk for these adverse events. In addition, there was no difference in the risk for placental abruption by aspirin dosage.The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that low-dose aspirin as preventive medication in women at increased risk for preeclampsia does not increase the risk for perinatal mortality.Evidence on long-term outcomes in offspring exposed in utero to low-dose aspirin is limited, but no developmental harms were identified by 18 months of age in the one study reviewed.The USPSTF concludes that the harms of low-dose aspirin in pregnancy are no greater than small.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, and IUGR in women at high risk for preeclampsia.</p>",
      "clinical": "There are no validated methods of identifying women at high risk for preeclampsia on the basis of biomarkers, clinical diagnostic tests, or medical history. Most clinicians use medical history to identify women at high risk. Risk factors, based on medical history, may help guide clinicians and their patients in the decision to begin aspirin use. <br><br>Although clinical risk assessments were not systematically reviewed for this recommendation, a pragmatic approach is described in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication#tab\">Table</a>. This approach may help to identify a patient population with an absolute risk for preeclampsia of at least 8%, which is consistent with the lowest preeclampsia incidence observed in control groups in studies reviewed by the USPSTF. Women with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin. Women with several moderate-risk factors may also benefit from low-dose aspirin (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication#tab\">Table</a>), but the evidence is less certain for this approach.

The preeclampsia incidence rate would be approximately &ge;8% in a pregnant woman with &ge;1 of these risk factors.<br>&Dagger; A combination of multiple moderate-risk factors may be used by clinicians to identify women at high risk for preeclampsia. These risk factors are independently associated with moderate risk for preeclampsia, some more consistently than others.<br>&sect; Moderate-risk factors vary in their association with increased risk for preeclampsia.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk for Adverse Effects</h3>\r\nLow-dose aspirin use in women at increased risk for preeclampsia has not been shown to increase the occurrence of placental abruption; postpartum hemorrhage; or fetal harms, such as intracranial bleeding and congenital anomalies.\r\n<h3>Use of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\nThe dosage and timing of initiation of low-dose aspirin varied across studies. However, the beneficial effects and small harms of low-dose aspirin were consistent across dosages and timing of initiation. It was not possible to determine from the evidence whether a specific dosage or timing of aspirin use conferred greater benefit over other dosages or intervals.\r\n<h4>Dosage</h4>\r\nLow-dose aspirin at dosages between 60 and 150 mg/d reduced the occurrence of preeclampsia, preterm birth, and IUGR in women at increased risk for preeclampsia in several randomized trials. The most commonly used dosage was 100 mg/d, but the 2 largest trials contributing to the estimates of benefit used 60 mg/d. Although studies did not evaluate a dosage of 81 mg/d, low-dose aspirin is available in the United States as 81-mg tablets, which is a reasonable dosage for prophylaxis in women at high risk for preeclampsia.\r\n<h4>Timing</h4>\r\nUse of low-dose aspirin was initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation. Evidence did not suggest additional benefit when use of aspirin was started earlier (12 to 16 weeks) rather than later (&ge;16 weeks) in pregnancy in women at increased risk for preeclampsia.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nResearch is needed on the effect of low-dose aspirin on the development of preeclampsia and how the magnitude of response to low-dose aspirin varies with individual or combined risk factors for preeclampsia. Research on how to improve clinicians' ability to identify women at increased risk for preeclampsia, particularly those who would receive the greatest benefit from aspirin as preventive medication, is also needed. Efforts to validate the effectiveness of risk assessment tools using clinical history alone or combined with clinical testing may help clinicians better identify high-risk women who will benefit from aspirin as preventive medication, and help reduce the incidence of preeclampsia and its consequent outcomes. <br><br>Further research in populations that bear the highest disease burden for preeclampsia, including African American and nulliparous women, is needed. Multivariable risk prediction models that identify healthy nulliparous women who are likely to develop preeclampsia are in development, but further refinement and validation are needed. Additional research to further assess preeclampsia risk in pregnant women with 1 or more moderate-risk factors is needed. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women from racial/ethnic populations that are at disproportionate risk, such as African American women, in order to have sufficient power to determine the effectiveness of different aspirin dosages and timing of initiation in these high-risk groups. <br><br>Larger studies investigating aspirin use in the first or early second trimester may improve the evidence base on optimal timing of low-dose aspirin as preventive medication. Other areas of research include optimal therapies that individualize the aspirin dosage and timing of administration (e.g., morning vs. bedtime). <br><br>In addition, studies that explore less well-established risk factors that may better identify women at high risk for preeclampsia are needed. Further research should also investigate whether preeclampsia prevention with low-dose aspirin affects women's long-term risk for cardiovascular disease and whether there are benefits to continuing low-dose aspirin after delivery in women with 1 or more high-risk factors.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends that all women planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 &micro;g) of folic acid.

      "other": "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends initiating use of low-dose aspirin (60 to 80 mg/d) during the late first trimester to prevent preeclampsia in women with a medical history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery (&lt;34 weeks) or history of preeclampsia in more than 1 previous pregnancy. <br><br>The World Health Organization recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (75 mg/d) starting as early as 12 to 20 weeks of gestation for high-risk women (i.e., those with a history of preeclampsia, diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal or autoimmune disease, or multifetal pregnancies). It states that there is limited evidence regarding the benefits of low-dose aspirin in other subgroups of high-risk women. <br><br>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that women at high risk for preeclampsia (i.e., women with a history of hypertension in a previous pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes, or chronic hypertension) take 75 mg/d of aspirin from 12 weeks until delivery. It recommends the same for women with more than 1 moderate-risk factor (first pregnancy, age &ge;40 years, pregnancy interval &gt;10 years, body mass index &ge;35 kg/m2, family history of preeclampsia, or multifetal pregnancies).<br><br>The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommend that women with chronic primary or secondary hypertension or previous pregnancy-related hypertension take low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks until delivery. <br><br>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<div>Preeclampsia is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with an unclear etiology and natural history. It is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and the second-leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.</div>\r\n<div>In 2010, preeclampsia affected 3.8% of deliveries in the United States. The rate of severe preeclampsia has increased over the past 3 decades. In the United States, 12% of maternal deaths are directly attributable to preeclampsia and eclampsia. However, morbidity is more common than mortality, and it is estimated that more than one third of severe obstetric complications are related to preeclampsia. <br><br>Preeclampsia accounts for 15% of preterm births in the United States and is a leading cause of medically indicated preterm birth. Delivery is the only cure for preeclampsia. Early-onset preeclampsia is usually more severe and often requires preterm delivery. Preterm infants (&lt;37 weeks of gestation) are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality, and complications increase with earlier delivery. Additional important threats to the fetus from preeclampsia include IUGR, being small for gestational age, placental abruption, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and neonatal death. It is estimated that perinatal mortality is about 2 times higher in pregnancies affected by preeclampsia.<br><br>There are racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. Non-Hispanic black women are at greater risk for developing preeclampsia than other women and bear a greater burden of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality. In the United States, the rate of maternal death from preeclampsia is higher in non-Hispanic black women than in non-Hispanic white women. Disparities in risk factors for preeclampsia, limited access to early prenatal care, and obstetric interventions may account for some of the differences in prevalence and clinical outcomes.</div>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<div>In 1996, the USPSTF reviewed the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia. The current review included new evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in women at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, as well as assessing the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy.</div>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<div>The USPSTF considered 15 RCTs (8 good-quality) in women at increased risk for preeclampsia to evaluate maternal and perinatal health benefits and 13 RCTs (8 good-quality) to evaluate preeclampsia incidence. All trials were placebo-controlled. One large trial was conducted in the United States, and another large, multinational trial was coordinated from the United Kingdom. Thirteen smaller trials were conducted in various developed countries. Preeclampsia incidence in women at increased risk ranged from 8% to 30% across studies. <br><br>In general, trial participants were young (mean age range, 20.3 to 31 years) and white. Only 1 trial of women at increased risk for preeclampsia and 2 trials reporting harms included majority populations of black women. None of the trials initiated use of low-dose aspirin before 12 weeks of gestation, and 8 trials initiated prophylaxis before 16 weeks. The most common discontinuation date was upon delivery; however, 6 trials stopped aspirin use before delivery, as early as 35 weeks of gestation or when preeclampsia developed. Aspirin dosages ranged from 60 to 150 mg/d, with the majority of trials using 60 mg/d (6 RCTs) or 100 mg/d (8 RCTs). Included trials defined \"high risk\" differently because a validated method for identifying women who are at increased risk for preeclampsia is lacking. <br><br>Two large RCTs, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) trial and the Collaborative Low-dose Aspirin Study in Pregnancy (CLASP), provided the majority of the data for pooled estimates of benefit. The MFMU trial was conducted at 13 U.S. study sites in women at increased risk for preeclampsia (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 2503). The treatment group received 60 mg/d of aspirin, but was instructed to stop taking the medication if preeclampsia developed. Women were at 13 to 26 weeks of gestation and belonged to 1 of the following predefined preeclampsia risk categories: pregestational diabetes mellitus (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 471), chronic hypertension (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 744), current multifetal gestation (<em>n</em>= 688), or preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 606). <br><br>CLASP was a multinational trial (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 9364) that included 16 sites (e.g., United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, and Hong Kong). Women were enrolled to prevent or treat preeclampsia and IUGR on the basis of medical history. Risk factors for preeclampsia were prior IUGR or preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, renal disease, age, family history of preeclampsia, and multifetal gestation. Women were still eligible for study participation if their clinician was unsure whether or not they should receive low-dose aspirin. Two thirds of participants began taking aspirin before 20 weeks of gestation. Use of low-dose aspirin (60 mg/d) was continued until delivery.</div>\r\n<h4>Perinatal Outcomes</h4>\r\n<div>The USPSTF found evidence of a 14% reduction in risk for preterm birth (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98]; 10 studies;&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 33.2%) among women at increased risk for preeclampsia who received low-dose aspirin (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 11,779). This reduction in risk for preterm birth resulted from a decrease in the number of women with preeclampsia, as well as a delay in the development of preeclampsia. Pooled estimates provided evidence of a 20% reduction in risk for IUGR (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99]; 13 studies;&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 36.0%) in women at increased risk for preeclampsia (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 12,504). Low-dose aspirin increased the mean birthweight of infants (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 10,712) by a pooled weighted mean difference of 130.0 g (95% CI, 36.2 to 223.3 g;&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 60%). There was no statistically significant reduction in perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.01]; 10 studies;&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 0%) in women at increased risk for preeclampsia (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 12,240).</div>\r\n<h4>Maternal Outcomes</h4>\r\n<div>The USPSTF found evidence of a 24% reduction in risk for preeclampsia (pooled RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95]; 13 studies) with low-dose aspirin use in women at increased risk (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 12,184). Heterogeneity was moderate across studies (<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 40.5%). Stratified comparisons did not show that the timing of aspirin initiation (&lt;16 weeks) or dosage had an effect on preeclampsia prevention. <br><br>Maternal complications of preeclampsia (e.g., the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count [HELLP] syndrome, organ system failure, eclampsia, or death) rarely occurred in studies and could not be evaluated. Pooled analysis of the outcome of cesarean delivery (10 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 10,419) indicated no difference in the cesarean delivery rate among women receiving aspirin compared with those receiving placebo (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.08];&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 24.9%).The number needed to treat was calculated from the event rate in the trial data at the lowest level of risk for the outcome. <br><br>The number needed to treat to prevent 1 diagnosis of preeclampsia was 42 (95% CI, 26 to 200); it was 71 (95% CI, 41 to 1429) for IUGR and 65 (95% CI, 38 to 455) for preterm birth. Absolute risk estimates based on observed event rates ranged from 2% to 5% for preeclampsia, 1% to 5% for IUGR, and 2% to 4% for preterm birth. Sensitivity analyses using an alternate method for estimating pooled random effects resulted in similar point estimates and CIs and did not change the statistical significance of results for benefits or harms.<br><br>Results from the USPSTF's review are generally consistent with the findings from a Cochrane Collaboration systematic review&nbsp;and an individual patient&ndash;data meta-analysis (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies [PARIS]). The Cochrane review included 59 trials (37,560 women), and the PARIS meta-analysis included data from 31 trials (32,217 women and 32,819 infants). Although there were differences in study inclusion criteria, the USPSTF found similar effect estimates for preeclampsia, IUGR, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, particularly compared with results from the PARIS meta-analysis.</div>\r\n<h4>Dosage and Timing</h4>\r\n<div>The USPSTF found no evidence from stratified comparisons that the timing of aspirin administration or the dosage had different effects. Comparison of dosage effects showed 1 outcome with a significant difference&mdash;preterm birth&mdash;when a cut-point of 75 mg/d was used. The reduction in risk for preterm birth was greater in studies using doses greater than 75 mg/d. However, the analyses were confounded by unequal distribution of sample sizes in different dosage categories because the largest studies (MFMU and CLASP) used 60 mg/d of aspirin. There was no evidence of a dose&ndash;response relationship. <br><br>In 15 trials, use of low-dose aspirin was initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation. None of the trials initiated use of aspirin before 12 weeks. In 8 trials, use of low-dose aspirin was initiated before 16 weeks. Evidence did not demonstrate benefit of starting aspirin earlier (12 to 16 weeks) rather than later (&ge;16 weeks) in pregnancy.</div>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<div>The USPSTF considered 19 RCTs (12 good-quality) and 2 good-quality observational studies to evaluate maternal, perinatal, and developmental harms. Studies of low- or average-risk pregnant women were included with trials of women at increased risk. <br><br>Low-dose aspirin use appeared to have no short-term harms during pregnancy. Eleven RCTs (23,332 women) reported on the outcome of placental abruption (6 trials in women with increased preeclampsia risk and 5 trials in women with low/average risk). Pooled analyses showed no statistically significant increase in abruption associated with aspirin (RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.48];&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 36.4%). <br><br>Eighteen trials reported on the outcome of perinatal mortality (with 4 smaller studies reporting no events). Pooled analyses (14 studies;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 22,848) on perinatal mortality (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.11];&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 0%) suggested no harm from low-dose aspirin. When limited to women at increased risk for preeclampsia (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 12,240), the estimate approached statistical significance for a benefit (RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.01]; 10 studies;&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 0%). <br><br>Nine trials (6 in women at increased preeclampsia risk and 3 in women at low risk; 22,760 women in total) reported on the outcome of postpartum hemorrhage. There was no evidence of a treatment effect (RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.09]). Five trials (1 good-quality) in a total of 2748 women reported on the outcome of blood loss. No evidence demonstrated that low-dose aspirin affected blood loss. Studies found slightly lower mean blood loss or equivalent amounts of blood loss between study groups. <br><br>The pooled relative risk for intracranial hemorrhage in neonates (6 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 22,158) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.16), with low heterogeneity (<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 27.1%;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;= 0.23). Maternal death was a rare outcome and could not be evaluated. <br><br>The USPSTF found limited evidence on long-term outcomes in offspring from in utero exposure to low-dose aspirin. One observational study of birth defects resulting from aspirin exposure showed that the rate of cryptorchidism did not differ between male infants exposed and unexposed to aspirin in utero. Another observational study on aspirin use during pregnancy had null findings for miscarriage. Follow-up data from the largest trial, CLASP, reported no differences in physical or mental developmental outcomes (e.g., gross motor development, height, weight, or hospital visits) in infants at 18 months of age.<br><br>Seven trials reported adverse events; however, most were determined to be unrelated to treatment. Two studies reported women withdrawing from treatment because of itching of the throat and epigastric pain.</div>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<div>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that daily low-dose aspirin use in women at high risk for preeclampsia is associated with improved health outcomes through the reduction of risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, and IUGR. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that low-dose aspirin use does not increase the risk for placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, fetal intracranial bleeding, or perinatal mortality. The USPSTF did not identify any harmful effects of low-dose aspirin use on long-term outcomes in offspring; however, evidence was limited. <br><br>Overall, the harms of low-dose aspirin use in pregnancy are considered to be no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the magnitude of net benefit of low-dose aspirin use to prevent morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia in women at high risk is substantial.</div>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<div>Preeclampsia is a complex, multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can originate from multiple causes. It is thought to evolve from changes in placental development that result in placental ischemia. Poor placental perfusion may produce inflammation and oxidative stress. Preeclampsia may also develop as a result of overactive inflammatory responses to normal placentation. Preexisting inflammatory conditions are also thought to trigger systemic inflammatory and oxidative stress processes. The anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenesis, and antiplatelet properties of low-dose aspirin are believed to account for its preventive effect on preeclampsia.</div>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<div>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 8 April to 5 May 2014. Some comments requested clarification about risk factors for preeclampsia and the dosage and timing of initiation of low-dose aspirin. In response to these comments, the USPSTF added language about populations that are at risk for preeclampsia and aspirin dosages in the Clinical Considerations section. The USPSTF also added language to the Table to clarify the populations at risk. The USPSTF added language on the timing of initiation of low-dose aspirin in the Research Needs and Gaps section. Finally, the USPSTF provided more details about study characteristics and results in the Discussion section.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nIn 1996, the USPSTF concluded that evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against the routine use of aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia or IUGR. Although a significant reduction in risk for preterm birth suggested benefits for infants, there was inadequate evidence that aspirin provided benefits for women at increased risk for preeclampsia. In addition, the studies available at that time indicated that aspirin use was associated with risk for placental abruption. As a result, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia in pregnant women at increased risk for preeclampsia. <br><br>This recommendation updates the 1996 recommendation. It differs from the previous recommendation in that new evidence on the effectiveness and harms of low-dose aspirin on maternal and perinatal health outcomes now allows the USPSTF to recommend its use in women at high risk for preeclampsia. This recommendation also differs from the 1996 recommendation in that it discusses defining \"high preeclampsia risk\" in pregnant women in more detail.</div>",

      "rationale": "<div>\r\n<h3>Importance</h3>\r\nChlamydia and gonorrhea are the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States. In 2012, more than 1.4 million cases of chlamydia and more than 330,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chlamydial infections are 10 times more prevalent than gonococcal infections (4.7% vs. 0.4%) in women aged 18 to 26 years.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Although most identified cases are reported, the incidence of chlamydia and gonorrhea is difficult to estimate because most infections are asymptomatic and are therefore never diagnosed. The CDC estimates that more than 800,000 persons are infected with gonorrhea in the United States each year, and fewer than half of these infections are diagnosed and reported.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women; however, asymptomatic infection may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its associated complications, such as ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Newborns of women with untreated infection may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia. Infection may lead to symptomatic urethritis and epididymitis in men, although gonorrhea is more likely than chlamydia to be symptomatic in men compared with women. Both types of infection may facilitate HIV transmission\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening tests can accurately detect chlamydia. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that screening tests can accurately detect gonorrhea.\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found adequate direct evidence that screening reduces complications of chlamydial infection in women who are at increased risk, with a moderate magnitude of benefit.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for gonorrhea results in a moderate magnitude of benefit based on the large proportion of cases that are asymptomatic, the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment to reduce infections, and the high morbidity associated with untreated infections.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea reduces complications of infection and transmission or acquisition of either disease or HIV in men. The magnitude of benefit is unknown.\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea are small to none.\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia is associated with moderate net benefit in all sexually active women aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for gonorrhea is associated with moderate net benefit in all sexually active women aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.</div>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant women.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nAge is a strong predictor of risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections, with the highest infection rates occurring in women aged 20 to 24 years, followed by females aged 15 to 19 years. Chlamydial infections are 10 times more prevalent than gonococcal infections in young adult women. Among men, infection rates are highest in those aged 20 to 24 years. <br><br>Other risk factors for infection include having a new sex partner, more than 1 sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI; inconsistent condom use among persons who are not in mutually monogamous relationships; previous or coexisting STI; and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Prevalence is also higher among incarcerated populations, military recruits, and patients receiving care at public STI clinics. There are also racial and ethnic differences in STI prevalence. In 2012, black and Hispanic persons had higher rates of infection than white persons. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and may want to consult local public health authorities for guidance on identifying groups that are at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated in specific geographic locations and communities.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>&nbsp;infections should be diagnosed by using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) because their sensitivity and specificity are high and they are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on urogenital sites, including male and female urine, as well as clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal, and male urethral specimens. Most NAATs that are approved for use on vaginal swabs are also approved for use on self-collected vaginal specimens in clinical settings. Rectal and pharyngeal swabs can be collected from persons who engage in receptive anal intercourse and oral sex, although these collection sites have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Urine testing with NAATs is at least as sensitive as testing with endocervical specimens, clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens, or urethral specimens that are self-collected in clinical settings. The same specimen can be used to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea.\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\nIn the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach would be to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result.\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\nChlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and expedited partner therapy are available at &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/default.htm\">www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/default.htm</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/ept/default.htm\">www.cdc.gov/std/ept/default.htm</a>, respectively. <br><br>Posttest counseling is an integral part of management of patients with a newly diagnosed STI. The USPSTF recommends offering or referral to high-intensity behavioral counseling for patients with current or recent STIs (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm</a>). Posttest counseling can also serve as an educational opportunity for patients who present with STI concerns but test negative for infection. It should address safe sex practices that can reduce disease transmission or reinfection; motivational interviewing strategies may also promote risk-reducing behaviors.<br><br>To maximize adherence, the CDC recommends that drug treatment be dispensed on site. The CDC recommends that all sex partners of infected patients from the preceding 60 days be evaluated, tested, and treated for infection. It also recommends that infected patients be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and no longer have symptoms. For a sex partner who cannot be linked to care, the CDC suggests that clinicians consider expedited partner therapy, which allows for the delivery of a drug or drug prescription to the partner by the patient, a disease investigation specialist, or a pharmacy. Because of a high likelihood of reinfection, the CDC also recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infection 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated.<br><br>In pregnant women, a test of cure to document eradication of chlamydial infection 3 weeks after treatment is recommended. Pregnant women diagnosed with a chlamydial or gonococcal infection in the first trimester should be retested 3 months after treatment. Gonococcal neonatal ophthalmia, which can be transmitted from an untreated woman to her newborn, may be prevented with routine topical prophylaxis at delivery. However, prevention of chlamydial neonatal pneumonia and ophthalmia requires prenatal detection and treatment.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nChlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in men but may result in urethritis, epididymitis, and proctitis. Uncommon complications include reactive arthritis (chlamydia) and disseminated gonococcal infection. Infections at extragenital sites (such as the pharynx and rectum) are typically asymptomatic. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections may facilitate HIV transmission in men and women. Median prevalence rates among men who have sex with men who were tested in STD Surveillance Network clinics in 2012 were 16% for gonorrhea and 12% for chlamydia.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nPotential harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea include false-positive or false-negative results as well as labeling and anxiety associated with positive results.\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\nAccording to the CDC, STIs in the United States are associated with an annual cost of almost $16 billion. Among nonviral STIs, chlamydia is the most costly, with total associated costs of $516.7 million (range, $258.3 to $775.0 million). Gonococcal infections are associated with total costs of $162.1 million (range, $81.1 to $243.2 million). <br><br>In 2008, estimated direct lifetime costs (in 2010 U.S. dollars) per case of chlamydial infection were $30 (range, $15 to $45) in men and $364 (range, $182 to $546) in women. Similarly, gonococcal infections were associated with direct costs of $79 (range, $40 to $119) in men and $354 (range, $182 to $546) in women.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nA review of health care claims of 4296 male and female patients presenting for general medical or gynecologic examinations from 2000 to 2003 found that a large proportion of those with high-risk sexual behaviors did not receive STI or HIV testing during their visit. According to a review of diagnostic billing codes for patients with high-risk sexual behaviors, men were significantly less likely than women to be tested for chlamydia (20.7% vs. 56.9%) and gonorrhea (20.7% vs. 50.9%), although they were more likely to be tested for HIV (79.3% vs. 38.8%) and syphilis (39.1% vs. 27.6%).\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has issued recommendations on screening for other STIs, including hepatitis B, genital herpes, HIV, and syphilis. The USPSTF has also issued recommendations on behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for STIs. These recommendations are available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe CDC provides more information about STDs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/default.htm\">www.cdc.gov/std/default.htm</a>. Its recommendations for STD prevention include clinical prevention guidance (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/clinical.htm\">www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/clinical.htm</a>) and patient prevention information (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm\">www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm</a>). The CDC has also issued guidance for clinicians on how to take a sexual history (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/SexualHistory.pdf\">www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/SexualHistory.pdf</a>). <br><br>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has issued several recommendations on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and teen pregnancy. The Community Guide discusses interventions that have been efficacious in school settings and for men who have sex with men (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/hiv/index.html\">www.thecommunityguide.org/hiv/index.html</a>). Canadian guidelines on STIs are available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/sti-its/cgsti-ldcits/index-eng.php\">www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/sti-its/cgsti-ldcits/index-eng.php</a>.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\nAlthough the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea differs, the risk factors for infection overlap and the USPSTF recommends screening for both simultaneously.\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nStudies evaluating the effectiveness of different screening strategies for identifying persons who are at increased risk for infection, cotesting for concurrent STIs, and different screening intervals are needed to inform practice guidelines. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic men to reduce the consequences of infection and transmission to sexual partners are needed. Identification of subgroups for whom screening may be effective is a high priority. Possible subgroups include men who have sex with men, sexually active males younger than 24 years, and men residing in high-prevalence communities. Currently, no studies provide data about the potential adverse effects of screening in any population.",

      "other": "The CDC recommends annual screening for chlamydia in all sexually active females aged 25 years or younger and in older women with specific risk factors (for example, those who have new or multiple sex partners and those reporting that their sex partner may have a concurrent sex partner), as well as screening for gonorrhea in sexually active females who are at increased risk for infection (such as those aged &lt;25 years). The CDC does not recommend routine screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in the general population. It recommends that clinicians consider screening for chlamydia in sexually active young men in high-prevalence settings. The CDC recommends annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men who have sex with men, based on exposure history, with more frequent screening in populations at highest risk. <br><br>The CDC recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea upon intake in juvenile detention or jail facilities in females aged 35 years or younger. It also recommends screening for gonorrhea in high-risk pregnant women and for chlamydia in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit. The CDC recommends retesting in the third trimester in pregnant women with continued risk for infection and in those who test positive at their first prenatal visit. <br><br>Because of the high likelihood of reinfection, the CDC also recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infections 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated. <br><br>The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 25 years or younger. It also recommends screening for chlamydia in women older than 25 years who have risk factors (such as new or multiple sex partners) and for gonorrhea in asymptomatic women who are at high risk for infection (such as those with a previous gonococcal infection, other STIs, or new or multiple sex partners, as well as inconsistent condom use, commercial sex work, or illicit drug use). <br><br>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in all sexually active females aged 25 years or younger. It recommends routine annual screening for rectal and urethral chlamydia in sexually active adolescent and young adult males who have sex with males if they engage in receptive anal or insertive intercourse, respectively, and routine annual screening for pharyngeal, rectal, and urethral gonorrhea if they engage in receptive oral, anal, or insertive intercourse, respectively. It recommends screening every 3 to 6 months for persons in this population if they are at high risk (for example, if they have multiple or anonymous partners, sex in conjunction with illicit drug use, or sex partners who participate in these activities). It also recommends screening adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to chlamydia or gonorrhea in the past 60 days from an infected partner. Clinicians should consider annual screening for chlamydia in sexually active males in settings with high prevalence rates, such as jail or juvenile correction facilities, national job training programs, STD clinics, high school clinics, and adolescent clinics (for patients who have a history of multiple partners). Clinicians should consider annual screening for gonorrhea in other sexually active and young adult males on the basis of individual and population-based risk factors. <br><br>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. It concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. <br><br>Canadian guidelines recommend screening for chlamydia in all sexually active males and females younger than 25 years and retesting at 6 months after treatment in infected patients. They also recommend screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea at the first prenatal visit and again during the third trimester in pregnant women who test positive or are at increased risk for infection.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nChlamydia and gonorrhea are the most commonly reported STIs in the United States<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-screening#citation1\">1</a>. In 2012, more than 1.4 million cases of chlamydial infection were reported to the CDC. However, its true incidence is difficult to accurately estimate because most infections are asymptomatic and are therefore undetected. Chlamydial infections are 10 times more prevalent than gonococcal infections (4.7% vs. 0.4%) in women aged 18 to 26 years. <br><br>In 2012, the rate of chlamydial infection in females (643.3 cases per 100,000) was more than double the rate in males (262.6 cases per 100,000), with the majority of cases occurring in females aged 15 to 24 years. In 2012, more than 330,000 cases of gonococcal infection were reported to the CDC. The majority of infections occurred in females aged 15 to 24 years and men aged 20 to 24 years. The infection rate was similar for females and males (108.7 vs. 105.8 cases per 100,000, respectively).\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF commissioned a systematic review&nbsp;of studies published since it previously reviewed these topics. The USPSTF also considered evidence from its previous recommendations and reviews. Included studies had to be applicable to clinical settings and practices in the United States, as determined by the similarity of participants, health care services, and available screening tests. Conditions of interest included chlamydial and gonococcal infections in asymptomatic patients. The key questions are described in the systematic review.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found convincing evidence that available screening tests can accurately diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections. Ten fair-quality studies on diagnostic accuracy&nbsp;indicate that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea with NAATs is highly accurate for specimens from various anatomical sites for women and men. <br><br>Sensitivity of NAAT specimens collected from genitourinary sites for detecting chlamydia ranged from 86% to 100% in studies without major limitations. In women, sensitivity of NAAT specimens varied slightly across endocervical specimens, clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens, and urine specimens that were self-collected in clinical settings. In men, testing of urine specimens was slightly more sensitive than testing of urethral specimens. Sensitivity of NAATs for gonorrhea ranged from 90% to 100% in studies without major limitations. Specificity was high across all specimens and tests for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nPrevious USPSTF reviews identified 2 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia for the prevention of PID in nonpregnant women at increased risk for infection. In 1 large RCT, a strategy of identifying, testing, and treating women at increased risk for cervical chlamydial infection was associated with significantly reduced incidence of PID (relative risk [RR], 0.44 [95% CI, 0.20 to 0.90]). Study limitations included a follow-up period of only 1 year, possible selection and ascertainment biases, and a relatively low participation rate. In another RCT, which was conducted in 1761 female high school students in Denmark, universal, 1-time, home-based screening was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of chlamydial infection (RR, 0.45 [CI, 0.24 to 0.84]) and a reduction in the incidence of PID that did not achieve statistical significance (RR, 0.50 [CI, 0.23 to 1.08]) compared with opportunistic physician-based screening after 1 year of follow-up. This study was rated as poor-quality because of significant loss to follow-up. <br><br>The current USPSTF review identified 1 good-quality RCT of 2529 sexually active young women recruited from universities and colleges in the United Kingdom. Among asymptomatic women, 0.6% in the screening group versus 1.6% in the deferred group developed PID during follow-up (RR, 0.39 [CI, 0.14 to 1.08]). Study limitations included inadequate recruitment, testing for chlamydia outside the study protocol in nearly one quarter of participants, and difficulty in PID ascertainment. These limitations may have attenuated intervention effects, and the study may have been underpowered. <br><br>The USPSTF previously found fair-quality evidence that treatment of chlamydial infection during pregnancy is associated with improved outcomes for infants and mothers. The USPSTF reviewed large cohort studies of screening at the first prenatal visit in pregnant women at increased risk for infection. These studies found that treatment of chlamydial infection was associated with significantly lower rates of preterm delivery, early rupture of membranes, and infants with low birthweight compared with no treatment or treatment failure. No subsequent studies met inclusion criteria for the current USPSTF review. <br><br>The USPSTF found little direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia in men or low-risk women. It found that the overall prevalence of chlamydial infection in the general population varies widely depending on age and other risk factors. Chlamydial infection may cause epididymitis in men, but serious complications are not common. Screening and treating young men at increased risk may reduce the incidence of chlamydial infection; however, the USPSTF found no published prospective trials of the effect of routine screening in men or comparison with the strategy of screening women and treating their male partners. The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of screening women, including pregnant women, who are not at increased risk for infection. Decisions about screening women who are not at high risk on the basis of individual factors may depend on local disease burden. <br><br>The USPSTF found no studies of the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in its current or previous reviews. It previously found indirect evidence of the benefits of early detection and treatment, including the substantial prevalence of asymptomatic infection, the availability of accurate screening tests and effective treatments, and the high morbidity associated with untreated infection in women. Gonococcal infections in women are frequently asymptomatic. Asymptomatic men and women represent an important reservoir of new infection. In women, 10% to 20% of untreated infections lead to PID, which may lead to hospitalization, surgery, chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. <br><br>Although untested in controlled trials, early detection and treatment of gonorrhea in pregnant women at increased risk for infection may decrease morbidity from infection-related obstetric complications. The primary rationale for screening all pregnant women is prevention of ophthalmia neonatorum. However, the USPSTF recognizes the low prevalence of infection in pregnant women who are not at increased risk and the effectiveness of universal ocular prophylaxis in newborns. Accordingly, the USPSTF concluded that the net benefit of screening for gonorrhea in pregnant women who are not at increased risk for infection is small. The USPSTF found little direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in men or low-risk women. It previously found that screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active adults is inefficient because of its low prevalence in these groups. Moreover, the majority of genital gonococcal infections in men are symptomatic, which can result in more timely clinical presentation and lead to diagnosis and treatment that prevents serious complications. <br><br>The USPSTF found no studies comparing the effectiveness of different screening strategies for chlamydia and gonorrhea in asymptomatic persons or the effectiveness of sampling from various anatomical sites, cotesting for concurrent STIs, or using different screening intervals.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nTen fair-quality studies on diagnostic accuracy (described previously)indicated that screening tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea had low rates of false-positive and false-negative results across all NAATs and specimen types. False-positive test results may occur more frequently among low-prevalence populations. <br><br>The current USPSTF review&nbsp;identified several published studies that describe some of the psychosocial harms of testing (such as anxiety and strain on relationships). However, these studies did not meet inclusion criteria because they included symptomatic persons and focused on reactions to positive test results rather than screening. No studies addressing other harms (for example, labeling or screening-related anxiety) met inclusion criteria.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found direct evidence that screening for chlamydia in women who are at increased risk for infection is associated with moderate benefit, including reduced incidence of PID in nonpregnant women and improved infant and maternal outcomes in pregnant women. The USPSTF noted the existence of shared risk factors for gonococcal and chlamydial infections as well as the availability of effective methods for their detection and treatment. On the basis of these factors, the USPSTF found indirect evidence of moderate benefit of screening for gonorrhea in women who are at increased risk for infection. The USPSTF found that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea is associated with harms that are small to none. Therefore, it concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea has a moderate net benefit in this population.<br><br>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence of the benefit of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men, although the harms from screening are small to none. It concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nChlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women. Untreated infections may progress to PID-related complications, such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility. Infections may also be transmitted to sex partners and newborn children. Accurate screening tests and effective antibiotic treatments are available for chlamydia and gonorrhea.<br><br>In men, chlamydial and gonococcal infections are more likely to cause symptoms that lead to diagnosis and treatment, and serious complications are less common; also, gonorrhea is more likely than chlamydia to cause symptoms. In the absence of empirical evidence that screening in men reduces disease transmission to women, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening in men are unknown.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 29 April to 26 May 2014. The USPSTF considered all comments received during this period. In response to comments, the USPSTF separated its recommendations on screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea, in recognition of differences in the diseases and the respective evidence. It clarified that the studies it reviewed on the direct effects of screening for chlamydia, including 1 new good-quality RCT, showed mixed results. This led to the change in grade for screening for chlamydia, which is now based on &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; certainty of a moderate net benefit rather than &ldquo;high certainty&rdquo; of a substantial net benefit. The USPSTF also clarified some of the differences between chlamydial and gonococcal infections in men and women. The revised recommendation statement also includes clarifications on risk assessment, screening tests, screening intervals, and treatments.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\nThis recommendation updates the USPSTF's previous recommendations on screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea. The totality of the current evidence met USPSTF criteria for moderate certainty of a moderate net benefit for screening for both infections. <br><br>In 2007, the USPSTF recommended screening for chlamydia in all sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. It recommended against screening for chlamydia in women aged 25 years or older who are not at increased risk. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia in men. <br><br>In 2005, the USPSTF recommended screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women (including pregnant women) who are at increased risk for infection (that is, if they are young or have other individual or population risk factors). It found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for gonorrhea in men who are at increased risk and in pregnant women who are not at increased risk. The USPSTF also recommended against routine screening for gonorrhea in men and women who are at low risk for infection. <br>&nbsp;",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Thyroid gland disorders are among the most common endocrine conditions evaluated and treated by clinicians. Thyroid dysfunction represents a continuum from asymptomatic biochemical changes to clinically symptomatic disease. In rare cases, it can produce life-threatening complications, such as myxedema coma or thyroid storm. .<br><br><em>Subclinical hypothyroidism</em>&nbsp;is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly but arbitrarily defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L. .<br><br>Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism</em>&nbsp;does not require the presence of symptoms and has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level. As such, it encompasses a range of low T4 levels that may (or may not) be associated with a set of relatively subtle and nonspecific clinical symptoms, such as fatigue, feeling cold, weight gain, hair loss, and constipation. <br><br><em>Subclinical hyperthyroidism</em>&nbsp;is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum TSH level below the lower threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) but normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are further classified as having &ldquo;low but detectable&rdquo; (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or &ldquo;clearly low&rdquo; or &ldquo;undetectable&rdquo; (&lt;0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels.<br><br>Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism</em>&nbsp;does not require the presence of symptoms and has been defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level. When present, symptoms are often relatively nonspecific (for example, weight loss, heart palpitations, heat intolerance, and hyperactivity).<br><br>For the purposes of this recommendation,&nbsp;<em>thyroid dysfunction</em>&nbsp;is defined as a spectrum of disorders related to the thyroid gland. The spectrum begins with asymptomatic subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. In the middle of the spectrum are asymptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, defined biochemically by changes in serum TSH and T4 levels. At the end of the spectrum is thyroid disease, which is reserved for symptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (that is, persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels and clearly associated clinical signs and symptoms that cannot be better explained by another condition).<br><br>In making its recommendations about clinical preventive services, the USPSTF focuses on asymptomatic populations that do not have known signs or symptoms of disease.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>Early detection and treatment of asymptomatic persons with abnormal serum TSH levels with or without abnormal T4 levels may be beneficial because it may prevent longer-term morbidity and mortality from fractures, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. However, widespread screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction can also result in harms due to labeling, false-positive results, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment.<br><br>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening can detect &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; serum TSH levels in asymptomatic persons. However, what constitutes an abnormal TSH level is uncertain. Laboratory reference intervals are based on the statistical distribution of TSH levels across the general population (for example, using the 97.5th percentile as an upper boundary for normal) rather than according to the association of a TSH level with symptoms, adverse outcomes, or particular risk factors for disease.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;There is professional disagreement about the appropriate cut points for the lower and upper boundaries of normal TSH levels in the general population and in subgroups, such as older adults, where values differ from the overall population distribution (for example, shifting to a higher range of normal).<br><br>Accurate interpretation of serum TSH levels is further complicated by measurement variability and the sensitivity of TSH secretion to conditions other than thyroid dysfunction. These issues have led many professional groups to recommend repeating thyroid function tests if the results fall above or below a specified reference interval for confirmation of persistent dysfunction (for example, over 3- to 6-month intervals) in asymptomatic persons before making a diagnosis or considering any treatment strategies, unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults leads to clinically important benefits. In particular, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether screening for thyroid dysfunction reduces cardiovascular disease or related morbidity and mortality. <br><br>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults does not improve quality of life or provide clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density, or lipid levels. It also does not improve cognitive function, at least through the duration of available trials (&ge;1 to 2 years).</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction. Indirect evidence points to the likelihood of important and frequent harms associated with screening in asymptomatic persons. Foremost among these are frequent false-positive results; the psychological effects of labeling; and a large degree of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biochemically defined abnormal TSH levels (with or without abnormal serum T4 levels) that may revert to normal, not progress, or never result in health problems even if they do progress, particularly in persons with TSH levels less than 10 mIU/L.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.<br><br>If clinicians offer screening for thyroid dysfunction to asymptomatic persons, they should first ensure that patients clearly understand the uncertainties surrounding any potential clinical benefit of screening as well as the possibility of harm this choice may engender.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nAbout 5% of women and 3% of men in the United States have subclinical hypothyroidism.&nbsp;Of note, several studies have shown that about 37% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state without intervention after several years.&nbsp;About 2% to 5% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism develop &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction.<br><br>One retrospective cohort study found that levothyroxine use in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with lower risk for ischemic heart disease events and overall mortality;&nbsp;however, the USPSTF did not identify any clinical trials that evaluated the causal relationship between treatment and subsequent cardiac events. The USPSTF did not identify any trials or observational studies that evaluated the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism (with or without symptoms) versus no treatment. <br><br>Subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 0.7% of the U.S. population and is more common in women than men.&nbsp;One quarter of persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time.&nbsp;An estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism (with or without symptoms). Persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress to &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism. <br><br>The USPSTF did not identify any studies that evaluated the benefits of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism on final health outcomes, such as fractures, cancer, or cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. Except for 1 small (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 67) nonrandomized study that examined bone mineral density, no evidence was found on the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism (with or without symptoms).\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nThe harms of treatment of thyroid dysfunction have not been well-studied. The most important potential harms are false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment. <br><br>False-positive results occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors, such as acute illness or certain medications. Ascertainment of true- versus false-positive results is further complicated by a lack of consensus on what constitutes a normal reference interval. <br><br>Consensus is also lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, particularly for hypothyroidism. No clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve clinical outcomes. On the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment (in part because of the higher likelihood of progression to &ldquo;overt&rdquo;&mdash;even if still asymptomatic&mdash;thyroid dysfunction). The decision of whether and when to begin therapy in patients with TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is more controversial.A large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is a likely consequence of screening for thyroid dysfunction, particularly because the disorder is defined by silent biochemical parameters rather than a set of reliable and consistent clinical symptoms. The high variability of TSH secretion levels and the frequency of reversion to normal thyroid function without treatment underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value as a basis for diagnosis or the decision to start therapy. <br><br>Currently, it is not possible to differentiate persons who will have advancing thyroid dysfunction of clinical importance from those whose TSH levels will remain biochemically stable or even normalize. Treating the latter group (at a minimum) will not lead to benefit, and these persons may experience harms associated with antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.<br><br>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nAlthough exact estimates are not available for the United States, screening for thyroid dysfunction by primary care providers seems to be a common practice.&nbsp; In the United Kingdom, an estimated 18% to 25% of the adult population receives thyroid function testing each year.<br><br>The annual number of dispensed prescriptions of levothyroxine sodium in the United States increased by 42% over a 5-year period, from 50 million in 2006 to 71 million in 2010.&nbsp;In 2013, there were more than 23 million new prescriptions and refills for a single name brand of thyroid hormone in the United States, making it the most commonly prescribed drug in the country.<br><br>In 1996, a cross-sectional study of a U.S. population found that 39% of participants with TSH levels between 5.1 and 10.0 mIU/L received treatment.&nbsp;More recent evidence suggests that the median TSH level at initiation of thyroid hormone therapy has decreased over time; a retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom found that the median TSH level at the time of first levothyroxine prescription decreased from 8.7 to 7.9 mIU/L between 2001 and 2009.<br><br>Initiation and use of thyroid hormone therapy seem to be particularly common in older adults. Data from the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study), a U.S. cohort of nearly 6000 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older, showed a steady increase in the overall percentage of older adults receiving thyroid hormone therapy (from 9% in 1989 to 20% in 2006) and a nonlinear probability of initiating levothyroxine therapy based on age; persons aged 85 years or older were more than twice as likely as those aged 65 to 69 years to begin thyroid hormone therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34 [95% CI, 1.43 to 3.85]), independent of race or sex.<br><br>Data on the proportion of asymptomatic persons with thyroid dysfunction who receive thyroid hormone therapy are lacking. However, given the high number of prescriptions for levothyroxine dispensed in the United States and the low prevalence of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism among persons in the general population (0.3% and 0.5%, respectively,&nbsp;only a small fraction of whom are symptomatic), it is reasonable to conclude that many asymptomatic persons receive treatment. Clinicians seem to be treating more persons with thyroid dysfunction, at earlier times after initial diagnosis, and at TSH levels closer to normal.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nThe most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. Risk factors for an elevated TSH level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism (possibly due in part to ablation therapy leading to iatrogenic thyroid dysfunction), and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area.<br><br>Common causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and functional thyroid nodules. Risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone.<br><br>The USPSTF found no direct evidence that treatment of thyroid dysfunction based on risk level alters final health outcomes.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe serum TSH test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction. Multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings. Follow-up testing of serum T4 levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction.\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\nThe optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.\r\n<h3>Interventions</h3>\r\nThe principal treatment for hypothyroidism is oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium). Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (such as methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (for example, radioactive iodine or surgery). Although definitive data are lacking, treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or less than 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. Treatment is typically not recommended for patients with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or when thyroiditis is the cause.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nAlthough detection and treatment of abnormal TSH levels (with or without abnormal T4 levels) in asymptomatic persons is common practice, evidence that this clinical approach improves important health outcomes is lacking. Long-term randomized, blinded, and controlled trials of screening for thyroid dysfunction would provide the most direct evidence on any potential benefits of this widespread practice. Serum TSH levels that define eligibility for enrollment, particularly based on age-specific ranges, are needed. Important clinical outcomes include cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality, as well as falls, fractures, functional status, and quality of life. Intermediate biochemical outcomes are less important; they are not reliable evidence of treatment effectiveness, and the effects of treatment of thyroid dysfunction on important clinical outcomes may be independent of any known intermediate outcomes. <br><br>Before conducting screening trials, it may be more feasible for researchers to conduct well-designed treatment trials of either subclinical or asymptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction versus watchful waiting (including intervention if overt dysfunction becomes symptomatic), using final health outcomes, such as cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, as the end points of interest. For such trials to be most informative, they should have clearly defined patient populations; intervention protocols (for example, treatment doses and target TSH levels); and study outcomes, including short- and long-term benefits and harms. <br><br>Long-term observational studies are needed to better understand the natural history of untreated, asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction based on different serum TSH and T4 levels, as well as outcomes in persons with common but nonspecific symptoms. Useful information might be available from ongoing studies that collect biochemical samples; detailed demographic data; and information on functional status, quality of life, and other final health outcomes. <br><br>Currently, the evidence does not show important benefits of treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on blood pressure, BMI, lipid levels, cognitive function, or quality of life. Although treatment is associated with harms, it could have important long-term benefits on final health outcomes (such as reduced bone fractures and cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality) that may be independent of known intermediate outcomes. For example, evidence indicates that if treatment is effective for fractures or cardiovascular disease prevention, it is due to factors other than improvements in bone mineral density or lipid levels.&nbsp;The need for randomized trials that evaluate the effect of treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on cardiac outcomes has been emphasized.&nbsp;Given the increasingly popular clinical practice of routine identification and treatment of asymptomatic persons with thyroid dysfunction and the treatment of those with vague and nonspecific symptoms, these trials are warranted. <br><br>Studies that evaluate the harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction are critically lacking. The USPSTF believes that false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment are important harms of any screening and prevention program and that these harms should be minimized. Additional evidence is needed on how to best communicate the clinical complexity surrounding screening for and treatment of asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction so that patients and their providers can make informed decisions. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Condition</h3>\r\nDisorders of the thyroid gland are among the most common endocrine conditions evaluated and treated by clinicians. According to data from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), about 46 per 1000 persons in the United States have subclinical hypothyroidism, 7 per 1000 have subclinical hyperthyroidism, 3 per 1000 have &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism, and 5 per 1000 have &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism. <br><br>Currently, the most common argument in favor of early treatment of thyroid dysfunction is the possible associations among untreated subclinical hypothyroidism, risk factors for heart disease, and subsequent coronary disease or heart failure. However, the epidemiological evidence for this argument is mixed, and the available studies (including several meta-analyses) had important methodological limitations, precluding certainty in their findings.&nbsp;If early treatment is effective in preventing coronary disease or heart failure, the current evidence suggests that it is probably through mechanisms other than mediation of blood pressure and lipid levels. <br><br>Recently, 2 prospective studies&mdash;Health ABC (Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study)&nbsp;and CHS&mdash;showed a correlation between subclinical hypothyroidism and congestive heart failure, particularly in persons with a serum TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L (HRs, 3.26 [CI, 1.37 to 7.77] and 1.88 [CI, 1.05 to 3.34], respectively). This possible association warrants further study; however, it is not known whether thyroid replacement therapy would modify this potential risk.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2004 recommendation on screening for thyroid disease. The review assessed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for subclinical and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction without clinically obvious symptoms, as well as the effects of treatment of screen-detected subclinical and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction on intermediate and final health outcomes. The review also evaluated the proportion of patients screened for thyroid dysfunction who have clinically apparent disease, the proportion with TSH levels of 10 mIU/L or less who are treated in current practice, and the cardiovascular consequences of untreated subclinical thyroid dysfunction.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nWhen used to confirm clinically suspected thyroid disease in patients referred to an endocrinologist, the serum TSH test has a sensitivity of about 98% and a specificity of about 92%.&nbsp;However, its accuracy is more challenging to ascertain when it is used to screen asymptomatic persons for thyroid dysfunction, for several reasons. First, there is no consensus on the appropriate TSH cutoff for a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Most laboratories define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L).&nbsp;However, laboratories use varying types of assays.&nbsp;More important, this threshold is arbitrary; it is not based on the risk for an adverse health outcome but simply a normal population distribution of values. <br><br>Second, TSH secretion varies among different subpopulations, such as those defined by race/ethnicity, sex, and age. For example, 12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L. Therefore the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; population reference interval for older adults is probably inappropriate.<br><br>Third, TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders. For example, serum TSH is frequently suppressed during phases of acute illness.&nbsp;Levels of TSH may also be affected by the administration of drugs or substances, such as iodine, dopamine, glucocorticoids, octreotide, or bexarotene.&nbsp;Adrenal insufficiency, pregnancy (particularly during the first trimester), anorexia nervosa, certain autoimmune diseases, and pituitary adenomas can also interfere with normal circulating levels of TSH. <br><br>Fourth, serum TSH levels can vary by as much as 50% of mean values on a day-to-day basis, with up to 40% variation of values obtained from serial TSH measurements performed at the same time of day.<br><br>All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent.<br>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Early Detection</h4>\r\nNo studies directly evaluated the effects of screening for thyroid dysfunction on morbidity (including quality of life and functional status) or mortality in the general population.\r\n<h4>Treatment of Hypothyroidism</h4>\r\nThree trials (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 239) found no statistically significant effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on blood pressure&nbsp;through 10.5 months of follow-up. Similarly, 6 trials (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 385) found no statistically significant effect of treatment on BMI or weight&nbsp;through 1 year of follow-up. <br><br>Evidence on the effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid levels is mixed. Several trials suggested potential beneficial effects, but the results are inconsistent and of uncertain clinical importance. In 8 good- or fair-quality trials (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 597), 3 of which reported statistically significant results, differences between the treatment and control groups ranged from &minus;0.7 to 0 mmol/L (&minus;28 to 0 mg/dL) for mean total cholesterol level and from &minus;0.6 to 0.1 mmol/L (&minus;22 to 2 mg/dL) for mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.&nbsp;No studies reported statistically significant differences in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#citation1\">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Whether changes in these intermediate outcomes due to treatment are adequate surrogates for cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is not known, and no trials directly evaluated the effects of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on final health outcomes, such as cardiac morbidity or mortality. <br><br>A single fair-quality retrospective cohort study by Razvi and colleagues examined the association between treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism and risk for cardiac events.&nbsp;The study identified 4735 persons aged 40 years or older with subclinical hypothyroidism (based on a single TSH value of 5.01 to 10.0 mIU/L) from the U.K. General Practice Research Database. Mean follow-up was 7.6 years, and participants were categorized a priori into 2 age groups (40 to 70 years or &gt;70 years). After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, socioeconomic status, blood pressure, total cholesterol level, smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, levothyroxine use, and index serum TSH level, levothyroxine use in the younger age group was associated with lower risk for fatal or nonfatal ischemic heart disease events (4.2% vs. 6.6%; HR, 0.61 [CI, 0.39 to 0.95]), death due to circulatory diseases (1.4% vs. 2.4%; HR, 0.54 [CI, 0.37 to 0.92]), and all-cause mortality (1.2% vs. 2.2%; HR, 0.59 [CI, 0.21 to 0.88]). There were no statistically significant associations between treatment and cardiovascular outcomes in the older age group. <br><br>One limitation of this study is that it did not adjust for the use of medications that reduce risk for cardiovascular disease, such as aspirin or lipid-lowering therapy. Residual confounding for these and other variables could be present, although baseline data did not show differences between the treatment groups.&nbsp;Although the results are promising and justify the prioritization of further research in this area, this study is ultimately hypothesis-generating rather than proof of effect. <br><br>This study also reported an association between use of levothyroxine and reduced risk for any cancer death in persons aged 40 to 70 years (1.2% vs. 2.2%; HR, 0.59 [CI, 0.21 to 0.88]).&nbsp;The authors noted that this was an unexpected finding that should therefore be interpreted with caution, particularly because it was not the primary study outcome. This finding further underscores the probable presence of residual confounding and emphasizes the need for experimental research to ascertain the true effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on cardiovascular outcomes. <br><br>In 2004, the USPSTF identified 5 trials that evaluated the effects of treatment on quality of life in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. Only 1 trial, in patients with recent Graves disease, found a positive effect of treatment.&nbsp;Since then, 4 good- or fair-quality trials (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 327) have been published, and none found a difference between persons receiving treatment and those receiving placebo through 1 year of follow-up. <br><br>Since the previous USPSTF review, 1 good-quality (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 94) and 1 fair-quality (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 69) trial have each found no effect of treatment of screen-detected subclinical hypothyroidism on various measures of cognitive function (such as cognitive skills and performance, cognitive status, speed of cognitive processing, and psychomotor tests of executive function) after 1 year.<br><br>No studies evaluated the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism (with or without symptoms) versus no treatment on any outcome.<br>\r\n<h4>Treatment of Hyperthyroidism</h4>\r\nNo fair- or good-quality studies evaluated the benefits of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.&nbsp;Two small (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 14 and 20) poor-quality trials found no differences between treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and no treatment on blood pressure, BMI, bone mineral density, or lipid levels. <br><br>The only identified evidence relevant to &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism was 1 small (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 67) nonrandomized study that evaluated the effects of treatment on bone mineral density.&nbsp;This study did not meet inclusion criteria and was not formally assessed as part of the systematic evidence review.<br><br>No trials evaluated the effects of treatment of hyperthyroidism (subclinical or &ldquo;overt&rdquo;) versus no treatment on final health outcomes.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Screening</h4>\r\nNo studies directly examined the harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction. However, screening clearly has potential harms, the most important of which are false-positive results, psychological effects of disease labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment. <br><br>False-positive results on serum TSH tests are common due to several factors. Secretion of TSH is sensitive to multiple factors unrelated to thyroid conditions; varies across time intervals, sometimes as short as a day; and varies depending on the population being considered (average TSH values may differ by age, sex, and race/ethnicity). In addition, there is no universally agreed-on &ldquo;normal&rdquo; TSH reference value, in part because it is not linked to the risk for actual adverse health outcomes. <br><br>Reliable estimates of the frequency of false-positive results from serum TSH tests are not available. A prospective observational study followed a cohort of 599 older adults after a single baseline TSH test, with repeated testing of 376 participants at the end of the study. It found that 37% (11 of 30) of participants with an initially elevated TSH level and 29% (5 of 17) with an initially low TSH level reverted to normal thyroid function after 3 years without intervention. Limitations of this study include the small number of affected participants, high loss to follow-up, and inability to distinguish between false-positive results and overdiagnosis with the methodological approach. <br><br>Labeling someone with a diagnosis of disease may have adverse psychological consequences, particularly in the case of an otherwise asymptomatic condition. Although the patient may have previously felt healthy, being informed that he or she has a disorder that requires medical surveillance or intervention can result in anxiety or changes to the patient&rsquo;s sense of well-being. A cross-sectional study of almost 34,000 persons aged 40 to 70 years found that women with known hypothyroidism were less likely to report good self-rated health compared with those without thyroid dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [CI, 0.41 to 0.59]).<br><br>Overdiagnosis of thyroid dysfunction is probably common, in part because the condition is defined biochemically rather than clinically and because disagreements persist about the appropriate cut points for classification of disease. The exact proportion of thyroid dysfunction diagnoses that are overdiagnoses is not known. However, many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time; others never progress to noticeable health problems, especially those who are asymptomatic and have &ldquo;mildly elevated&rdquo; (4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L) TSH levels. <br><br>In 1 prospective study, 102 women aged 60 years or older with subclinical hyperthyroidism (defined as a TSH level of 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L, as measured at baseline and 12 weeks after study entry) but normal T3 and T4 levels were followed for a mean of 41 months without intervention. At the end of the study, 24 women (24%) had TSH levels that had spontaneously normalized.&nbsp;A second prospective study evaluated the natural history of subclinical hypothyroidism. The study followed 107 persons aged 55 years or older with newly diagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as a TSH level &gt;5.0 mIU/L on 2 serial measurements before study entry) for a mean of 32 months without intervention. After this time, 40 participants (37%) had reverted to a euthyroid state. Of note, nearly half of the persons in this population had been referred to the study clinic by their general practitioner because of the incidental discovery of an elevated TSH level during routine &ldquo;analytical lab checking.&rdquo; Forty-four percent also reported 1 or more symptoms commonly associated with hypothyroidism. <br><br>Overdiagnosis is of concern because it leads to the psychological consequences of labeling and unnecessary treatment. It is a fundamental harm that should be avoided in disease prevention and health promotion.<br><br>\r\n<h4>Treatment</h4>\r\nAs with screening, limited evidence is available to assess the harms of treatment of thyroid dysfunction. <br><br>Levothyroxine therapy is a synthetic preparation of a natural hormone found in the body. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine generally lasts for many years. Despite its previous widespread use in the United States, levothyroxine sodium was not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until 2000. However, its approval process did not include studies that evaluated short- or long-term adverse effects. The product label cites possible adverse effects on bone mineral density and the cardiovascular system, such as angina, arrhythmia, and increased cardiac wall thickness.<br><br>The previous review found that one quarter of patients who received levothyroxine were inadvertently maintained on doses high enough to make TSH levels undetectable. Although the ultimate effect of long-term overdosing with levothyroxine is unknown, it could increase risk for osteoporosis, fractures, abnormal cardiac output, or ventricular hypertrophy.<br><br>Five trials published since the previous review assessed the harms of treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and generally reported no indication of harms or no or minimal (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 0 to 2) withdrawals from treatment due to adverse effects. However, harms were poorly assessed and reported, and the studies were not designed or powered to evaluate long-term or serious harms or harms related to overtreatment.<br><br>In the case of asymptomatic hyperthyroidism, overtreatment may be of even greater concern given that one treatment option is ablation of the thyroid gland followed by thyroid replacement therapy. Patients who are overdiagnosed and overtreated could develop iatrogenic hypothyroidism and become dependent on lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. Overtreatment is also of concern because it can introduce opportunity costs; clinicians and patients may spend time focused on certain areas of health at the expense of other conditions or care needs that are of higher priority for the patient&rsquo;s overall well-being.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found no direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults and therefore considered the indirect evidence on screening accuracy, benefits of early treatment, and harms. There is adequate evidence that the serum TSH test can identify abnormal levels of the hormone; however, substantial debate surrounds what constitutes an abnormal TSH level. Thresholds vary for different populations, such as older adults. Although a single fair-quality observational study found a possible association between treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and reduced risk for cardiac events, there is no evidence from randomized trials to prove that early treatment of thyroid dysfunction leads to clinically important benefits. The harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction have been poorly studied. However, screening and treatment have real potential harms, and these harms are probably common. Overall, the USPSTF was unable to estimate the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 28 October to 24 November 2014. In response to the comments received, the USPSTF clarified some of the terminology used in this statement (for example, &ldquo;reference interval&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;reference range&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hashimoto thyroiditis&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Hashitoxicosis&rdquo;) and added a reference for initiation and use of thyroid hormone therapy in older adults. The USPSTF also clarified that the systematic evidence review searched for studies on the treatment of thyroid dysfunction that used placebo or no treatment as the comparator. <br><br>Some comments noted that it would be unacceptable for clinicians to allow patients with &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction to participate in a trial with a placebo group (and that this therefore explains the lack of current evidence on the topic), but the USPSTF disagrees with this position. There are no high-quality data showing that treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons affects important health outcomes, such as cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality, fractures, or quality of life and functional status. Given the widespread practice of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons and the absence of high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of this approach, a pressing research need for this field is well-designed randomized treatment trials of subclinical and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction versus watchful waiting (with the important caveat that patients would be provided therapy if they became notably symptomatic). <br><br>It is clear from the comments received that the current terminology used to describe disorders of the thyroid generates substantial confusion, not only among the public but among clinicians and researchers as well. The terms &ldquo;thyroid dysfunction&rdquo; and &ldquo;thyroid disease&rdquo; are frequently used interchangeably to encompass all forms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, regardless of whether the patient has clinical signs or adverse consequences of illness. The term &ldquo;overt thyroid dysfunction&rdquo; is particularly misleading given that an &ldquo;overt&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;done or shown openly; plainly or readily apparent&rdquo;) condition is usually associated with obvious signs and symptoms of disease. In the case of thyroid dysfunction, &ldquo;overt&rdquo; dysfunction has been defined by biochemical parameters (serum TSH and T4 levels) that may not be associated with clinically evident symptoms or adverse health outcomes. The USPSTF believes that alternative terms are needed to more accurately describe thyroid dysfunction&mdash;reserving the term &ldquo;overt thyroid disease&rdquo; to describe symptomatic patients who also have persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels.\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nThis recommendation replaces the 2004 USPSTF recommendation on screening for thyroid disease. In this update, the USPSTF has restricted its definition of thyroid disease to symptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (that is, persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels and clearly associated clinical signs and symptoms that cannot be better explained by another condition). There is a broad spectrum of thyroid disorders, and the USPSTF recognizes that screening with the serum TSH test can detect changes along any point in this spectrum. Thus, the USPSTF changed the scope of its recommendation statement to screening for thyroid dysfunction to emphasize that screening can detect biochemical abnormalities as well as potentially clinically important disease. Despite this change, the USPSTF&rsquo;s ultimate assessment is the same as in the previous recommendation; the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults (I statement).<br><br>&nbsp;",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>High blood pressure is a prevalent condition, affecting approximately 30% of the adult population.&nbsp;It is the most commonly diagnosed condition at outpatient office visits. High blood pressure is a major contributing risk factor to heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. In 2010, it was the primary or contributing cause of death for more than 362,000 Americans.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The evidence on the benefits of screening for high blood pressure is well-established. In 2007, the USPSTF reaffirmed its 2003 recommendation to screen for hypertension in adults aged 18 years or older (A recommendation). Previous evidence reviews commissioned by the USPSTF found good-quality evidence that screening for hypertension has few major harms and provides substantial benefits.&nbsp;However, these reviews did not address the diagnostic accuracy of different blood pressure measurement protocols or identify a reference standard for measurement confirmation. For the current recommendation, the USPSTF examined the diagnostic accuracy of office blood pressure measurement, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM). The USPSTF also assessed the accuracy of these blood pressure measurements and methods in confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. In addition, it reviewed data on optimal screening intervals for diagnosing hypertension in adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found good evidence that screening for and treatment of high blood pressure in adults substantially reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found good evidence that screening for and treatment of high blood pressure has few major harms.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for high blood pressure in adults is substantial.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older without known hypertension.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<h4>Office Blood Pressure Measurement</h4>\r\nOffice measurement of blood pressure is most commonly done with a manual or automated sphygmomanometer. Little research has been done on the best approach to measuring blood pressure in the office setting. Most clinical trials of hypertension treatment, at a minimum, used the mean of 2 measurements taken while the patient was seated (some used the mean of the second and third measurements), allowed for at least 5 minutes between entry into the office and blood pressure measurement, used an appropriately sized arm cuff, and placed the patient&rsquo;s arm at the level of the right atrium during measurement. Multiple measurements over time have better positive predictive value for hypertension than a single measurement. Automated office blood pressure, which is an average of multiple automated measurements taken while the patient is alone in a room, may yield results similar to those of daytime ABPM.Blood pressure is affected by various short-term factors, such as emotions, stress, pain, physical activity, and drugs (including caffeine and nicotine). In addition to within-patient temporal variability, isolated clinic hypertension in the medical setting and in the presence of medical personnel (known as &ldquo;white coat&rdquo; hypertension) is well-documented. Epidemiologic data suggest that 15% to 30% of the population believed to have hypertension may have lower blood pressure outside of the office setting.&nbsp;The disadvantages of diagnosing hypertension solely in the office setting include measurement errors, the limited number of measurements that can be made conveniently, and the confounding risk for isolated clinic hypertension.\r\n<h4>Ambulatory and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring</h4>\r\nIn addition to office blood pressure measurement, ABPM and HBPM may be used to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension after initial screening. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small, portable machines that record blood pressure at regular intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities and while they are sleeping. Measurements are typically taken at 20- to 30-minute intervals. Home blood pressure measurement devices are fully automated oscillometric devices that record measurements taken from the patient&rsquo;s brachial artery. Many of these devices are available for retail purchase, and some have undergone technical validation according to recommended protocols. <br><br>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that ABPM is the best method for diagnosing hypertension. Although the criteria for establishing hypertension varied across studies, there was significant discordance between the office diagnosis of hypertension and 12- and 24-hour average blood pressures using ABPM, with significantly fewer patients requiring treatment based on ABPM (Figure 1). &nbsp;Elevated ambulatory systolic blood pressure was consistently and significantly associated with increased risk for fatal and nonfatal stroke and cardiovascular events, independent of office blood pressure (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).&nbsp;For these reasons, the USPSTF recommends ABPM as the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. <br><br>Good-quality evidence suggests that confirmation of hypertension with HBPM may be acceptable. Several studies showed that elevated home blood pressure was significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality, independent of office blood pressure (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).&nbsp;However, fewer studies have compared HBPM with office blood pressure measurement, so the evidence is not as substantial as it is for ABPM.&nbsp;Therefore, the USPSTF considers ABPM to be the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. However, the USPSTF acknowledges that the use of ABPM may be problematic in some situations. Home blood pressure monitoring using appropriate protocols is an alternative method of confirmation if ABPM is not available. Measurements from the office, HBPM, and ABPM all must be interpreted with care and in the context of the individual patient. Patients with very high blood pressure or signs of end-organ damage may need immediate treatment.\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends annual screening for adults aged 40 years or older and for those who are at increased risk for high blood pressure. Persons at increased risk include those who have high-normal blood pressure (130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg), those who are overweight or obese, and African Americans. Adults aged 18 to 39 years with normal blood pressure (&lt;130/85 mm Hg) who do not have other risk factors should be rescreened every 3 to 5 years<em>.</em>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends rescreening with properly measured office blood pressure and, if blood pressure is elevated, confirming the diagnosis of hypertension with ABPM.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nThe benefits of treatment of hypertension in preventing important health outcomes are well-documented. Moderate- to high-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of the general population of persons aged 60 years or older to a target blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg in reducing the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease events. Similarly, RCTs demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of younger adults to a target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg in reducing cerebrovascular events, heart failure, and overall mortality. &nbsp;In the absence of sufficient RCT data, expert opinion has been used to establish a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg in adults younger than 60 years&nbsp;and some experts believe that this should also be maintained in those aged 60 years or older.&nbsp;However, published results from a recently completed large RCT, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, are not yet available to inform current treatment goals. Clinicians should consult updated blood pressure treatment guidelines informed by this trial as they become available. <br><br>For nonblack patients, initial treatment consists of a thiazide diuretic, calcium-channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin-receptor blocker. For black patients, initial treatment is thiazide or a calcium-channel blocker. Initial or add-on treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease consists of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (not both).<br><br>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Implementation</h3>\r\nScreening for high blood pressure may be done in the office setting by using the proper methods described previously. However, the USPSTF recommends confirmation outside of the clinical setting before a diagnosis of hypertension is made and treatment is started. Confirmation may be done by using HBPM or ABPM. Because blood pressure is a continuous value with natural variations throughout the day, repeated measurements over time are generally more accurate in establishing a diagnosis of hypertension. The USPSTF did not find evidence for a single gold standard protocol for HBPM or ABPM. However, both may be used in conjunction with proper office measurement to make a diagnosis and guide management and treatment options. Blood pressure cuffs used for HBPM should be compliant with sphygmomanometer standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nMost of the evidence supports ABPM as the best method for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension. More research is needed on the accuracy of HBPM versus ABPM and the best HBPM protocols for follow-up of elevated office blood pressure. The diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure measurements taken by a visiting nurse or another health care worker in the home setting also merits more research. Self-use blood pressure measurement kiosks in community settings, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, may be frequently used by the public but are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. More research on the accuracy of kiosk measurements is needed. New technology has been developed that uses a wireless brachial blood pressure monitor that connects to a smartphone, a desktop computer, or the Internet for recording and analysis. More research is needed on the accuracy of these monitors, their use in primary prevention, and their association with long-term health outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nHypertension is a prevalent condition, affecting 29.1% of U.S. adults in 2011 to 2012.&nbsp;Prevalence rates increase with age, from 7.3% in persons aged 18 to 39 years to 32.4% in those aged 40 to 59 years and to 65.0% in those aged 60 years or older. Non-Hispanic black adults have the highest prevalence (42.1%) compared with white (28.0%), Hispanic (26.0%), and Asian (24.7%) Americans. Uncontrolled hypertension is a risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and congestive heart failure and a major contributing factor to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the United States.&nbsp;Persons with high blood pressure often have no signs or symptoms of the condition; however, once diagnosed, it is usually amenable to treatment.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nIn its previous evidence reviews, the USPSTF found substantial indirect evidence to support the effectiveness of screening for high blood pressure in adults.&nbsp;For the current recommendation statement, the USPSTF examined the diagnostic accuracy of different methods for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension after initial screening. The USPSTF also examined data to determine the optimal rescreening interval for diagnosing hypertension.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found 1 new study that directly assessed screening for high blood pressure in an adult population.&nbsp;This study was a good-quality cluster RCT of community-based pharmacy screening in adults aged 65 years or older living in Ontario, Canada. Results showed 3 fewer annual cardiovascular-related hospitalizations per 1000 persons in the intervention group compared with the no-screening group (rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.97]). However, because this study was limited to adults aged 65 years or older, the USPSTF concluded that there is still inadequate direct evidence about the benefits and harms of screening for hypertension in younger adults. Substantial indirect evidence continues to support the net benefit of screening for high blood pressure in adults aged 18 years or older.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<h4>Office Blood Pressure Measurement</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF did not find evidence suggesting that a particular office blood pressure measurement protocol is more accurate than any other.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Data comparing manual (ausculatory) versus automated office blood pressure measurement with a reference standard, such as ABPM, are lacking. The USPSTF found that office blood pressure variably predicted true hypertension, as defined by the reference standard of ABPM. Isolated elevated clinic blood pressure was not confirmed after ABPM in approximately 5% to 65% of study participants (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).Positive predictive values (with ABPM as the reference standard) increased with the following factors: patient population characteristics, such as age; blood pressure; and the number of abnormal screening results before confirmation. Given the variability of office blood pressure in predicting sustained, true hypertension, confirmatory measurement is needed for patients with elevated blood pressure at the initial office screening.\r\n<h4>Ambulatory and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF found that elevated 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure was consistently and significantly associated with stroke and other cardiovascular outcomes, independent of office blood pressure and with greater predictive value. Because of its large evidence base, ABPM is considered the best confirmatory test for hypertension. The USPSTF found 9 studies that evaluated the predictive value of 24-hour ABPM on long-term health outcomes.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Four studies found that each 10&ndash;mm Hg increment in ambulatory blood pressure (adjusted for office measurements) was significantly associated with increased risk for fatal and nonfatal stroke (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).&nbsp;Six studies found that each 10&ndash;mm Hg increment was associated with increased risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.11 to 1.42 (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). <br><br>Home blood pressure monitoring may also be a reasonable confirmatory method but has less evidence to support its use. Four good-quality studies found that elevated blood pressure with HBPM showed a significant association with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.17 to 1.39 (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\nNo clinical trials randomly assigned patients to different rescreening intervals and evaluated clinical outcomes. Many observational studies have followed patients over time to determine how many develop hypertension at intervals of 1 to 5 years.&nbsp;These data are summarized in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#tab\">Table</a>. <br><br>The percentage of patients who are diagnosed with hypertension after confirmatory monitoring is significantly higher among African Americans, persons with an initial high-normal blood pressure (130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg), those who are obese or overweight, and those older than 40 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;In most studies, the risk for hypertension exceeded 20% at 3 to 5 years in persons with at least 1 of these risk factors. Given the higher incidence of hypertension in populations with these risk factors, annual screening may be warranted for persons aged 40 years or older, African Americans of any age, and persons who are overweight or obese. Blood pressure exceeding the optimal level of less than 120/80 mm Hg may confer a graded risk; persons with blood pressure closest to the threshold for a diagnosis of hypertension have a higher incidence of hypertension at rescreening. Adults aged 18 to 39 years with no other risk factors have a low incidence of hypertension (about 1% to 6% at 2 years).<br><br>The USPSTF recommends rescreening with adequate office blood pressure measurement using the techniques described previously and, if indicated, confirmation with ABPM. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be performed every year in high-risk persons and every 3 to 5 years in those at low risk (adults aged 18 to 39 years with no risk factors).\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found 9 studies that evaluated the harms of screening for high blood pressure.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Four studies found no significant differences in psychological distress or quality of life before versus after participants were labeled with hypertension or prehypertension.&nbsp;Four studies addressed harms associated with ABPM and found that use of the monitoring device was associated with sleep disturbances, discomfort, and restrictions in daily activities.&nbsp;These studies suggest that the harms of screening may be relatively minor and short-term in nature. However, persons with isolated elevated clinic blood pressure who do not receive confirmatory ABPM or HBPM may be misdiagnosed with hypertension and could subsequently experience the more serious harms of unnecessary drug treatment. Misdiagnosis of hypertension is an area that warrants future research.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF determined that the benefits of screening for high blood pressure in adults to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are substantial and that the harms of screening are small. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening is substantial.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 23 December 2014 to 26 January 2015. The USPSTF reviewed all public comments received in response. The USPSTF acknowledges the current barriers to implementation of its recommendation, including the availability and affordability of ABPM. In response, it revised the final recommendation to include HBPM as an alternative for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension when ABPM is not feasible. The USPSTF also provided more information on the implementation of diagnostic confirmation and industry standards for home blood pressure monitors.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Updates of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nThis recommendation updates the 2007 reaffirmation recommendation statement on screening for high blood pressure in adults. The current statement recommends screening for high blood pressure using office blood pressure measurement and confirming a diagnosis of hypertension with ABPM. In addition, the USPSTF recommends optimal screening intervals for diagnosing hypertension in adults.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Cigarette smoking results in more than 480,000 premature deaths each year and accounts for approximately 1 in every 5 deaths.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1\">1</a> In pregnant women, smoking increases the risk for congenital anomalies; perinatal complications, such as preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and placental abruption; miscarriage and stillbirth; and neonatal or pediatric complications, such as sudden infant death syndrome and impaired lung function in childhood.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1\">1-4</a> An estimated 42.1 million U.S. adults (nearly 18% of the population) currently smoke.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation5\">5</a></p>\r\n<h3>Recognition of Behavior</h3>\r\n<p>The benefits of assessing patients&rsquo; smoking behavior are well-established. Common approaches for clinicians include recording a patient&rsquo;s smoking status as a vital sign or using the 5 A&rsquo;s: 1) Ask about smoking; 2) Advise to quit through clear, personalized messages; 3) Assess willingness to quit; 4) Assist in quitting; and 5) Arrange follow-up and support. Another approach is &ldquo;Ask, Advise, Refer,&rdquo; which encourages clinicians to ask patients about tobacco use, advise them to quit, and refer them to telephone quit lines and/or other evidence-based cessation interventions.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Interventions</h3>\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions (including in-person behavioral support and counseling, telephone counseling, and self-help materials) alone or combined with pharmacotherapy substantially improve achievement of tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that pharmacotherapy interventions, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release (buproprion SR), and varenicline&mdash;with or without behavioral counseling interventions&mdash;substantially improve achievement of tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that using 2 types of NRT moderately improves achievement of tobacco smoking cessation over using 1 type and that addition of NRT to treatment with bupropion SR provides additional benefit over use of bupropion SR alone. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the effect of ENDS on achievement of tobacco smoking cessation.</p>\r\n<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions substantially improve achievement of tobacco smoking abstinence in pregnant women, increase infant birthweight, and reduce risk for preterm birth. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of NRT and no evidence on the benefits of bupropion SR, varenicline, or ENDS to achieve tobacco cessation in pregnant women who smoke or to improve perinatal outcomes in infants.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Interventions</h3>\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF determined that there is adequate evidence to bound the magnitude of harms of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke as small to none. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of NRT, bupropion SR, or varenicline for tobacco cessation in adults who smoke are small. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of ENDS.</p>\r\n<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF determined that there is adequate evidence to bound the magnitude of harms of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant women who smoke as small to none. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of NRT and no evidence on the harms of bupropion SR, varenicline, or ENDS for tobacco cessation in pregnant women who smoke.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions and FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults who smoke is substantial.The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation on perinatal outcomes and smoking abstinence in pregnant women who smoke is substantial.The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant women is insufficient because of a lack of studies, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the use of ENDS for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women, is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF has identified the lack of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) on ENDS that report smoking abstinence or adverse events as a critical gap in the evidence.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older, including pregnant women. The USPSTF previously issued a separate recommendation statement on primary care interventions for tobacco use in children and adolescents (available online at <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). Although the USPSTF acknowledges that tobacco may be used in other forms and that other substances aside from tobacco may be smoked, they are not the focus of this recommendation.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nAccording to the 2012&ndash;2013 National Adult Tobacco Survey, smoking prevalence is higher in the following groups: men; adults aged 25 to 44 years; persons with a race or ethnicity category of &ldquo;other, non-Hispanic&rdquo;; persons with a GED (vs. graduate-level education); persons with an annual household income of less than $20,000; and persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.&nbsp;Higher rates of smoking have been found in persons with mental health conditions.\r\n<h3>Implementation Considerations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h3>\r\nThe information that follows on the implementation of interventions for smoking cessation draws from the USPSTF systematic evidence review&nbsp;and the 2008 Public Health Service guidelines.\r\n<h4>Assessment of Smoking Status</h4>\r\nThe 5 A&rsquo;s framework (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/5steps.html\">www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/5steps.html</a>) is a useful strategy for engaging patients in discussions about smoking cessation. This program includes the following: 1) Asking every patient about tobacco use, 2) Advising all tobacco users to quit, 3) Assessing their willingness to attempt to quit, 4) Assisting with attempts to quit, and 5) Arranging follow-up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ask, Advise, Refer&rdquo; is another approach and involves asking patients about tobacco use, advising those who smoke to quit, and referring them to evidence-based interventions. Treating smoking status as a vital sign and recording smoking status at every health visit are also frequently used to assess smoking status. Because many pregnant women who smoke do not report it, using multiple-choice questions to assess smoking status in this group may improve disclosure.\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\nBoth intervention types (pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions) are effective and recommended; combinations of interventions are most effective, and all should be offered. The best and most effective combinations are those that are acceptable to and feasible for an individual patient; clinicians should consider the patient&rsquo;s specific medical history and preferences and offer and provide the combination that works best for the patient.\r\n<h5>Many behavioral interventions are available to encourage smoking cessation in adults. These interventions can be delivered in the primary care setting or can be referred to community settings with feedback to the primary care provider. Effective behavioral interventions include in-person behavioral support and counseling, telephone counseling, and self-help materials (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#tab\">Table</a>). Behavioral interventions may increase rates of smoking abstinence from a baseline range of approximately 5% to 11% in control groups to 7% to 13% in intervention groups.</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Both minimal (&lt;20 minutes in 1 visit) and intensive (&ge;20 minutes plus &gt;1 follow-up visit) physician-advice interventions effectively increase the proportion of adults who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent for at least 6 months.</li>\r\n<li>Brief, in-person behavioral counseling sessions (&lt;10 minutes) effectively increase the proportion of adults who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent for 1 year. Although less effective than longer interventions, even minimal interventions (&lt;3 minutes) have increased cessation rates in some studies.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There is a dose&ndash;response relationship between the intensity of counseling and cessation rates (that is, more or longer sessions improve cessation rates).\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Several sessions should be provided; according to the Public Health Service guidelines, patients should receive at least 4 in-person counseling sessions.</li>\r\n<li>Cessation rates may plateau after 90 minutes of total counseling contact time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Effective interventions can be delivered by various types of primary care providers, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and cessation counselors.</li>\r\n<li>Both individual and group counseling are effective.</li>\r\n<li>Effective counseling interventions provide social support and training in practical problem-solving skills.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Training in problem-solving skills includes helping persons who smoke to recognize situations that increase their risk for smoking, develop coping skills to overcome common barriers to quitting, and develop a plan to quit.</li>\r\n<li>Basic information about smoking and successful quitting should be provided.</li>\r\n<li>Complementary practices that improve cessation rates include motivational interviewing, assessing readiness to change, and offering more intensive counseling or referrals.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Telephone counseling interventions are effective.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Effective interventions provide at least 3 telephone calls.</li>\r\n<li>Telephone counseling can be provided by professional counselors or health care providers who are trained to offer advice over the telephone.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProviding self-help materials (primarily print-based) that are tailored to the individual patient (that is, beyond a brochure that simply describes the health effects of smoking) is also effective in improving smoking abstinence.&nbsp;Evidence on nontailored, print-based, self-help materials; computer-based programs; and mobile phone&ndash;based interventions (such as mHEALTH) is mixed, although several trials show promise.\r\n<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The only pharmacotherapy interventions approved by the FDA for the treatment of tobacco dependence in adults are bupropion SR, varenicline, and NRT (including nicotine transdermal patches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, or nasal spray).</li>\r\n<li>Evidence suggests that rates of smoking abstinence may increase from approximately 10% in control groups (placebo or no pharmacotherapy) to 17% in persons using any form of NRT, from roughly 11% in control groups (placebo or no bupropion SR) to 19% in those using bupropion SR, and from approximately 12% in control groups (placebo) to 28% in those using varenicline. Information on dosing regimens is available in the package inserts of individual medications or at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov\">http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov</a>. Information for consumers on FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is available at <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm198176.htm\">www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm198176.htm</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Combinations of Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Using 2 types of NRT has been found to be more effective than using a single type. In particular, there was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid-delivery form of NRT is more effective than using a single type.</li>\r\n<li>Some studies suggest that NRT in combination with bupropion SR may be more efficacious than bupropion SR alone but not necessarily NRT alone.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Combinations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Combining behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions may increase cessation rates from approximately 8% to 14%&nbsp;compared with usual care or minimal behavioral interventions (such as self-help materials or brief advice on quitting).\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>These combination interventions often have behavioral components delivered by specialized cessation counselors or trained staff and often use NRT.</li>\r\n<li>Combination interventions often involve several sessions (&ge;4) and tend to be more successful with more sessions.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The largest effect was found in interventions that provided 8 or more sessions, although the difference in effect among the number of sessions was not significant.</li>\r\n<li>Contact time ranged from 0 to greater than 300 minutes; interventions lasting 91 to 300 minutes were most common.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The addition of behavioral support to pharmacotherapy also significantly increased cessation rates from approximately 18% in persons using pharmacotherapy alone to 21% in those using a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral support.</li>\r\n<li>Intensity of behavioral support ranged from 0 to greater than 300 minutes of contact; interventions most often involved greater than 91 minutes of contact (roughly 40% were 91 to 300 minutes, and 60% were &gt;300 minutes).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>\r\n<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Effective behavioral interventions in pregnant women who smoke include counseling, feedback, health education, incentives, and social support. Compared with usual care or controls, behavioral interventions can increase rates of smoking abstinence from approximately 11% to 15% in pregnant women.</li>\r\n<li>Effective behavioral interventions provided more intensive counseling than minimal advice and other standard components of usual care.</li>\r\n<li>Counseling sessions augmented with messages and self-help materials tailored for pregnant women who smoke increased abstinence rates during pregnancy compared with brief, generic counseling interventions alone.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Counseling specific to pregnant women should include messages about the effects of smoking on both maternal and fetal health and clear, strong advice to quit as soon as possible. Although smoking cessation at any point during pregnancy yields substantial health benefits for the expectant mother and baby, quitting early in pregnancy provides the greatest benefit to the fetus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Other Interventions</h4>\r\nHealth care system&ndash;based strategies that have been shown to improve rates of clinical interventions for smoking cessation in primary care settings include implementing an identification system for tobacco users; providing education, resources, and feedback to promote clinician intervention; and dedicating staff to provide treatment for tobacco dependence and assessing the delivery of this treatment in staff performance evaluations.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nPrimary care clinicians may find the following resources useful in talking with adults and pregnant women about smoking cessation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheets on quitting smoking (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm\">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm</a>), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; BeTobaccoFree (<a href=\"http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/quit-now/index.html#professionals\">http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/quit-now/index.html#professionals</a>), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; SmokeFreeWomen (<a href=\"http://women.smokefree.gov/pregnancy-motherhood.aspx\">http://women.smokefree.gov/pregnancy-motherhood.aspx</a>), and the Public Health Service&rsquo;s 2008 clinical practice guidelines. <br><br>In addition, the following resources may be useful to primary care clinicians and practices trying to implement interventions for smoking cessation: the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&ndash;Health Resources and Services Administration Center for Integrated Health Solutions&rsquo; resources for smoking cessation (<a href=\"http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/health-wellness/wellness-strategies/tobacco-cessation-2\">www.integration.samhsa.gov/health-wellness/wellness-strategies/tobacco-cessation-2</a>), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state and community resources for tobacco-control programs (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/index.htm\">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/index.htm</a>), and the World Health Organization&rsquo;s toolkit for delivering brief smoking interventions in primary care (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/smoking_cessation/9789241506953/en\">www.who.int/tobacco/publications/smoking_cessation/9789241506953/en</a>).\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>\r\n<h4>Pharmacotherapy for Pregnant Women</h4>\r\nAlthough smoking prevalence is lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant women of the same age, approximately 1 in 6 pregnant women aged 15 to 44 years smoke.&nbsp;Smoking during pregnancy slows fetal growth, doubles the risk for delivering a baby with low birthweight, and increases the risk for fetal death by 25% to 50%. For women in whom behavioral counseling does not work, other options to promote smoking cessation may be beneficial. <br><br>A few studies have evaluated the benefit of NRT on perinatal and child health outcomes. Although results generally suggest a potential benefit, the overall evidence is too limited to draw clear conclusions. Nicotine replacement therapy is a pregnancy category D medication, which means that there is positive evidence of fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans. However, it has been suggested that NRT may be safer than smoking during pregnancy.&nbsp;Potential adverse events reported include increased rates of cesarean delivery, slightly increased diastolic blood pressure, and skin reactions to the patch. Potential adverse events reported in nonpregnant adults include higher rates of low-risk cardiovascular events, such as tachycardia. There is no evidence of perinatal harms from NRT, although few trials reported consistently on these adverse events.<br><br>The USPSTF identified no studies on bupropion SR or varenicline pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. These drugs are both pregnancy category C, which means that animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus but there are no adequate well-controlled studies in humans.<br><br>In the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy in pregnant women, clinicians are encouraged to consider the severity of smoking behavior in each patient and engage in shared decision making to determine the best individual treatment course.\r\n<h4>ENDS</h4>\r\nApproximately 69% of adults who smoke daily report interest in quitting, and roughly 43% attempted to quit in the previous year.&nbsp;To date, no ENDS manufacturer has applied for or received FDA approval to market its product for smoking cessation purposes. According to a small 2013 study, approximately two thirds of physicians reported that they believed that electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were a helpful aid for smoking cessation, and 35% recommended them to patients.&nbsp;A recent small survey of e-cigarette users found that 56% reported using them to quit or reduce cigarette use, and 26% reported using them to smoke in places where conventional cigarettes were banned.&nbsp;Because of the perception by the public and clinicians that ENDS may be used for quitting conventional smoking, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence in this area. No studies evaluated the use of ENDS for smoking cessation in pregnant women or adolescents. The USPSTF identified only 2 RCTs that evaluated the effect of e-cigarettes on smoking abstinence in adults and found mixed results. Neither study reported any serious adverse events related to ENDS use; however, potential concerns raised in other literature include the unknown safety and toxicity of their components and aerosols,&nbsp;and poisoning in children who mishandle nicotine cartridges.&nbsp;How the ingredients in ENDS may affect a fetus is also unknown. Overall, the USPSTF found the evidence on the use of ENDS as a smoking cessation tool in adults, including pregnant women, and adolescents to be insufficient.\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nGiven the public health significance of the consequences of tobacco use, numerous public health interventions aim to prevent tobacco use and promote smoking cessation. The Community Preventive Services Task Force offers several recommendations on interventions that can be used in community settings (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco/index.html\">www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco/index.html</a>). The Surgeon General&rsquo;s report, &ldquo;The Health Consequences of Smoking&mdash;50 Years of Progress,&rdquo; discusses initiatives to end the tobacco use epidemic in the United States.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;In addition, the USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent the initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (available at<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<br><br><strong><br></strong>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nA large body of evidence on interventions for smoking cessation already exists, and the overall benefit of pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling to promote smoking cessation is well-established. However, further research is still needed to elucidate specific effective features of complex behavioral counseling interventions, benefits of pharmacotherapy in specific subpopulations, and the efficacy of newer technology-based interventions. Although numerous behavioral interventions for smoking cessation are available to primary care clinicians, further research is needed to better clarify the effects of varying levels of intensity (such as how the number of sessions and number of minutes per session affect continuous abstinence rates), which settings of behavioral counseling interventions are most conducive to quitting (individual vs. group, health vs. community, and primary care vs. specialty), and ways to tailor self-help materials. Further research is needed on the benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy in specific subpopulations, such as pregnant women and adults with mental health conditions. Research that directly compares types of pharmacotherapy in different populations may help inform providers on which interventions to use with which patients. Additional research is also needed on interventions for light or nondaily smokers and to better understand the effectiveness of newer technology platforms for interventions for smoking cessation, such as Internet-based programs, mobile or smartphone applications, and text-messaging programs. Although no ENDS manufacturer has applied to the FDA to have its product approved as a therapeutic device, because of the perception by both the public and clinicians that ENDS may be used as an option for quitting conventional smoking, further research is needed on the safety, benefits, and harms of ENDS.<br><br>",

Both the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&nbsp;and the American Heart Association&nbsp;recommend that e-cigarettes be included in smoking screening questions. The American Heart Association also concludes that evidence is insufficient to counsel patients on the use of e-cigarettes as a primary cessation aid.

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nTobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Smoking increases the risk for all-cause mortality and has been found to increase risk for various types of cancer (such as lung, liver, and colorectal), respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and tuberculosis), cardiovascular disease (such as stroke from secondhand smoke), diabetes, impaired immune function and autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis), eye disease (such as age-related macular degeneration), and erectile dysfunction in men. Smoking early in pregnancy has been found to cause ectopic pregnancy and orofacial clefts in infants.According to National Health Interview Survey data from 2013, a total of 42.1 million adults in the United States (17.8%) smokes cigarettes.&nbsp;Rates are higher among men; adults aged 24 to 44 years; lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender adults; multiracial groups and American Indians or Alaska Natives; persons whose highest education level attained is a GED; and persons living below the poverty level.&nbsp;Adults with mental health conditions have higher smoking rates and tend to smoke a higher average number of cigarettes than adults without mental health conditions. Approximately 27% of persons with a mental health or substance use disorder smoke.Based on data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System, 23.2% of women smoked during the 3 months before conception.&nbsp;Data from 2011 showed that 55% of women quit smoking during pregnancy, roughly 10% of pregnant women smoked during the last 3 months of pregnancy, and 40% of women relapsed within 6 months of delivery.&nbsp;Smoking during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and sudden infant death syndrome. Prenatal smoking contributed to an estimated 5.3% to 7.7% of preterm deliveries, 13.1% to 19.0% of low-birthweight term deliveries, 23.2% to 33.6% of cases of sudden infant death syndrome, and 5.0% to 7.3% of preterm-related deaths in 2002.Quitting smoking is one of the most important and yet challenging preventive health measures a person can take to improve his or her health. Most smokers make several serious attempts to quit before achieving permanent abstinence.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe current review focused on appraising evidence on interventions for smoking cessation that are relevant to primary care (behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy, and complementary or alternative therapy) in adults, including pregnant women. Only pharmacotherapy interventions that were approved by the FDA as first-line agents for smoking cessation were included (NRT, bupropion SR, and varenicline). Health outcomes included all-cause mortality, tobacco-related mortality and morbidity, and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Smoking-cessation outcomes had to be reported at 6 months or later to be included; findings on smoking reduction (based on frequency or quantity only), intention to quit, and cessation at less than 6 months were excluded. The USPSTF also evaluated adverse events reported at any time point.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Interventions</h3>\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF reviewed 11 good- or fair-quality systematic reviews on behavioral interventions, including complementary or alternative therapies, and smoking-cessation outcomes.&nbsp;Evidence on increasing smoking abstinence was strongest for physician and nurse advice, tailored self-help materials, and telephone counseling. Based on a 2013 systematic review of 28 studies (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 22,239),&nbsp;rates of smoking abstinence at 6 months or more were 8.0% in groups that received physician advice compared with 4.8% in groups that received no advice or usual care (risk ratio [RR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.56 to 1.96]). Based on pooled analyses of 35 studies from a 2013 systematic review that evaluated advice delivered by nurses, 13.3% of participants who received interventions from nurses achieved smoking abstinence at 6 months or more compared with 11.3% of those who received usual care or minimal intervention (RR, 1.29 [CI, 1.20 to 1.39]).&nbsp;When stratified by intensity level, both minimal advice (defined as a single session lasting &lt;20 minutes with &le;1 follow-up session) and intensive advice (defined as a single session lasting &ge;20 minutes or &gt;1 follow-up session) from a physician significantly increased cessation rates compared with no advice. In a subset of 15 trials that directly compared intensive versus minimal advice from physicians, intensive advice significantly increased smoking abstinence compared with minimal advice (RR, 1.37 [CI, 1.20 to 1.56]).Based on pooled analyses of 32 studies from a 2014 review of print-based self-help materials (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 40,890), participants who received tailored self-help materials showed a significantly higher rate of smoking abstinence at 6 months or more than control participants (7.1% vs. 5.8%; RR, 1.28 [CI, 1.18 to 1.37]). However, no significant improvement was seen when nontailored materials were compared with no self-help materials (RR, 1.06 [CI, 0.98 to 1.16]), based on pooled analyses of 33 studies (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 29,495).&nbsp;A 2013 review on telephone counseling interventions found that recruiter-initiated telephone support improved rates of smoking cessation at 6 months or more.Based on pooled analyses of 12 studies (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 30,182), abstinence rates were significantly higher in participants who received several counseling sessions via a telephone quit line than in those who received only a single session or self-help materials (10.7% vs. 7.6%; RR, 1.41 [CI, 1.20 to 1.66]). Pooled analyses of 51 studies (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 30,246) found that recruiter-initiated telephone counseling that did not result from patients&rsquo; calls to help lines also showed a benefit on smoking abstinence rates at 6 months or more compared with controls (13.1% vs. 9.7%; RR, 1.27 [CI, 1.20 to 1.36]). The USPSTF also reviewed the 2008 Public Health Service guidelines on treating tobacco use and dependence for additional details on intensity and content of behavioral interventions, as well as type of staff providing counseling for smoking cessation.&nbsp;The USPSTF also considered evidence from additional reviews on mobile phone and Internet-based interventions.&nbsp;Although findings suggested a benefit, there were too few studies and the studies were too heterogeneous to draw definitive conclusions. The USPSTF also considered evidence from reviews on biomedical risk assessment interventions, exercise, and hypnotherapy for smoking cessation; the studies were too limited to draw conclusions.&nbsp;A 2014 review on the use of acupuncture for smoking cessation (9 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 1892) did not find increased rates of smoking cessation at 6 to 12 months.\r\n<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF reviewed 3 good-quality systematic reviews on pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. A 2012 systematic review on NRT (117 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 51,265)&nbsp;found that 17.3% of participants taking any form of NRT achieved abstinence at 6 months or more compared with 10.3% of participants receiving placebo or taking no NRT (RR, 1.60 [CI, 1.53 to 1.68]). Those who used 2 forms of NRT achieved higher abstinence rates than those who used just 1 (20.6% vs. 15.6%; RR, 1.34 [CI, 1.18 to 1.51]). All studies of dual NRT used the patch plus another type of NRT (such as gum, nasal spray, or inhaler), although which form served as the control varied. All single forms of NRT significantly improved cessation rates at 6 months or more (gum: RR, 1.49 [CI, 1.40 to 1.60]; patch: RR, 1.64 [CI, 1.52 to 1.78]; tablets or lozenges: RR, 1.95 [CI, 1.61 to 2.36]). A 2014 systematic review on the use of antidepressants for smoking cessation (44 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 13,728) found that bupropion SR was associated with a significantly higher rate of smoking abstinence at 6 months or more than placebo or no bupropion SR (19.7% vs. 11.5%; RR, 1.62 [CI, 1.49 to 1.76]). Based on a smaller number of studies (14 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 6166), a 2012 systematic review&nbsp;found that varenicline was associated with a higher cessation rate than placebo (28.0% vs. 12.0%; RR, 2.27 [CI, 2.02 to 2.55]). Pooled analyses found that NRT plus bupropion SR was more effective than bupropion SR alone (RR, 1.24 [CI, 1.06 to 1.45]; 4 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>= 1991); however, it was not more effective than NRT alone (RR, 1.19 [CI, 0.94 to 1.51]; 12 studies). Smaller subsets of studies from these reviews directly compared types of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Abstinence rates among participants using NRT versus bupropion SR at 6 months or more did not significantly differ (8 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 4086).&nbsp;Two studies (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 778) compared NRT and varenicline and found no significant difference between groups.&nbsp;Four studies evaluated bupropion SR versus varenicline; although not all of the studies found a significant difference, a pooled estimate (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 1810) found a lower cessation rate with bupropion SR than varenicline (RR, 0.68 [CI, 0.56 to 0.83]).\r\n<h5>Combinations of Behavioral Interventions and Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\nCombinations of behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation were also effective.&nbsp;A 2012 good-quality systematic review (40 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 15,021)&nbsp;found that participants who received combination pharmacotherapy and intensive behavioral counseling had a higher abstinence rate at 6 months or more compared with control participants who received usual care, self-help materials, or brief advice on quitting (which was less intensive than the counseling or support given to the intervention groups) (14.5% vs. 8.3%; RR, 1.82 [CI, 1.66 to 2.00]). Most studies (27 of 40) used NRT as the pharmacotherapy and offered at least 4 behavioral counseling sessions (33 of 41). Another good-quality systematic review&nbsp;found that abstinence rates at 6 months or more were higher in participants who received behavioral support as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy than in those who received pharmacotherapy alone (21.4% vs. 18.3%; RR, 1.16 [CI, 1.09 to 1.24]). Most studies (27 of 38) offered NRT alone as the pharmacotherapy. Participants in the control group may have also received some counseling or support, but it was less intensive than in the intervention group. Most studies (28 of 38) offered at least 91 minutes of total contact time, and many (16 of 38) offered greater than 300 minutes.\r\n<h5>ENDS</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF identified only 2 fair-quality RCTs that reported on the effects of e-cigarettes for stopping conventional cigarette smoking. One study&nbsp;of persons not attempting or wishing to quit found a higher abstinence rate at 12 months in participants using e-cigarettes than in control participants (11.0% vs. 4%;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;= 0.04), whereas a larger study found no significant difference in abstinence rates at 6 months.&nbsp;Neither trial was conducted in the United States.\r\n<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>\r\n<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>\r\nBased on a good-quality systematic review of 86 studies done in 2013,&nbsp;the USPSTF found that behavioral interventions in pregnant women (including behavioral counseling, feedback, health education, incentives, and social support) are effective at improving rates of smoking cessation as well as perinatal health outcomes. Compared with control participants (most often defined as usual care or less intensive interventions), pregnant women who received any type of behavioral intervention before the third trimester had higher cessation rates late in pregnancy (15.2% vs. 11.2%; RR, 1.45 [CI, 1.27 to 1.64]). Their children also had improved mean birthweight (mean difference, 40.78 g [CI, 18.45 to 63.10 g]), rates of low birthweight (RR, 0.82 [CI, 0.71 to 0.94]), and rates of preterm birth (RR, 0.82 [CI, 0.70 to 0.96]). When analyzed separately, behavioral counseling (the behavioral intervention in most studies) was effective in increasing abstinence rates in late pregnancy and mean birthweight in infants.\r\n<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF found a much smaller body of evidence on pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in pregnant women. Only 5 RCTs (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 11,922) evaluating NRT use were found; there were no published trials on the use of bupropion SR or varenicline as an intervention for smoking cessation in pregnant women.&nbsp;The NRT studies reported very low (as low as &lt;25%) adherence rates, which limited the interpretability of findings. Meta-analysis of these 5 trials showed no significant improvement in rates of smoking abstinence late in pregnancy (10.8% vs. 8.5%; RR, 1.24 [CI, 0.95 to 1.64]). Given the small number of studies that reported on perinatal health outcomes, meta-analysis was not done. Although results on preterm birth were mostly in the direction of benefit, only 1 study&nbsp;showed a significant benefit. Reported results on mean birthweight and stillbirth were mixed. The largest trial (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 1050) reported a higher rate of survival with no impairment at 2 years in children whose mothers received NRT during pregnancy.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Interventions</h3>\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>\r\nEvidence on harms of behavioral interventions for smoking cessation is limited. Based on the evidence reviewed by the USPSTF, only minor adverse events related to ear acupuncture, ear acupressure, and other auriculotherapy were identified. Adverse events related to other forms of behavioral interventions were not reported.\r\n<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\nA 2014 fair-quality systematic review&nbsp;of 21 studies (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 11,647) found that NRT use was associated with a higher rate of all cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.81 [CI, 1.35 to 2.43]) compared with placebo. This result seems to be driven by minor events, such as tachycardia and arrhythmia. No significant increase in major cardiovascular adverse events was found (RR, 1.38 [CI, 0.58 to 3.26]). An older fair-quality review from 2010&nbsp;also found higher rates of heart palpitation and chest pain, nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms, and insomnia in NRT users than control participants. The patch was associated with an increase in skin irritation, and oral NRT was associated with throat soreness, mouth ulcers, and hiccups. Based on a subset of 8 studies, this older review also found no difference in mortality rates in participants using NRT versus control participants (odds ratio, 0.74 [CI, 0.33 to 1.67]). The same systematic review also evaluated the potential harms of bupropion SR for smoking cessation (27 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 10,02).&nbsp;No significant difference was found between groups using bupropion SR versus placebo in all cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.03 [CI, 0.71 to 1.50]). A trend toward reduction in major cardiovascular adverse events was found in the bupropion SR group (RR, 0.57 [CI, 0.31 to 1.04]). A good-quality review (33 studies;&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 9631) found an increased rate of serious adverse events in bupropion SR users versus those using placebo or controls that was of borderline significance (RR, 1.30 [CI, 1.00 to 1.69]).&nbsp;On the basis of 19 studies,&nbsp;the current USPSTF review found no significant increase in serious psychiatric events with bupropion SR (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.28 to 1.28]). It found 10 reported cases of seizures among 13,000 study participants. Bupropion SR labels include a boxed warning about serious neuropsychiatric events in persons who take bupropion SR for smoking cessation. Concerns have been raised about varenicline and potential cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric harms. In 2012, the FDA issued a safety communication indicating a nonsignificant increase in major adverse cardiovascular events.&nbsp;Based on a fair-quality systematic review done in 2014,&nbsp;a meta-analysis of 18 studies (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 9072) showed no significant increase in all cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.24 [CI, 0.85 to 1.81]) or major cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.44 [CI, 0.73 to 2.83]). Varenicline labels contain a boxed warning about serious neuropsychiatric events; however, none of the evidence reviewed by the USPSTF reported on this outcome. A good-quality systematic review done in 2012&nbsp;found an increased risk for 1 or more serious adverse events in participants using varenicline compared with those receiving placebo (RR, 1.36 [CI, 1.03 to 1.81]), but the type of serious adverse event was not specified. Most recently, the FDA issued a warning and approved updated labeling to describe a potential but rare occurrence of seizures with varenicline use and a potential interaction between varenicline and alcohol.\r\n<h5>Combinations of Behavioral Interventions and Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF did not identify any reports of adverse events related to combinations of behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy.\r\n<h5>ENDS</h5>\r\nNeither of the 2 trials on e-cigarette use for conventional smoking cessation reported any serious adverse events related to product use or any difference in the frequency of adverse events.&nbsp;One study&nbsp;reported a higher number of serious adverse events in the nicotine e-cigarette group (27 [19.7%]) than in the nicotine patch group (14 [11.8%]). However, the authors stated that they did not find any evidence on an association with the study product, and there was no difference in overall incidence of adverse events (serious and nonserious) between groups (incidence rate ratio, 1.05 [CI, 0.82 to 1.34]). Although it was not reported in the 2 trials, concerns have been raised about potentially harmful ingredients in e-cigarettes.&nbsp;Because of the large number and variation of available devices and cartridge fluids and the lack of regulation, the toxicity and safety of e-cigarettes and ENDS are extremely difficult to determine uniformly.Inadvertent poisoning in children who mishandle nicotine cartridges is also a concern, and the number of calls to poison centers involving nicotine-containing e-cigarette liquids has increased from 1 per month in 2010 to 215 per month in 2014.&nbsp;Based on estimates from a recent small survey, dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes may be high: 9.4% of persons who smoke conventional cigarettes reported concurrently using e-cigarettes, and 76.8% of persons who use e-cigarettes reported concurrently smoking conventional cigarettes.&nbsp;Further research is needed to better understand how dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes may affect attempts at cessation and initiation of smoking.\r\n<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>\r\n<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF did not find any serious adverse events related to behavioral interventions for smoking cessation in pregnant women. According to 1 systematic review,&nbsp;an increase in smoking was reported in 4 out of 86 studies.\r\n<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\nEvidence on harms from pharmacotherapy interventions for smoking cessation in pregnant women is limited. The USPSTF found no evidence of perinatal harms, although the number of studies was low and they were underpowered for rare outcomes.&nbsp;Similarly, there were too few studies to make any definitive determination on maternal harms of NRT. Maternal harms of NRT that have been reported in some studies include increased rates of cesarean delivery, slightly increased blood pressure (1 study reported an increase of 0.02 mm Hg per day in diastolic blood pressure over time,&nbsp;and skin reaction to the NRT patch.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions (such as physician and nurse advice, tailored self-help materials, and telephone counseling) provided or referred to by primary care providers substantially improve achievement of smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that there are no harms of behavioral interventions. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of providing behavioral interventions for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults is substantial.\r\n<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF found convincing evidence that pharmacotherapy with NRT, bupropion SR, or varenicline substantially improves achievement of smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. Evidence is also convincing that using 2 types of NRT moderately improves achievement of smoking cessation over single forms and that the addition of NRT to treatment with bupropion SR provides additional benefit over use of bupropion SR alone. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of pharmacotherapy, including serious cardiovascular adverse events and neuropsychiatric events, are small. It concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of providing pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults is substantial.\r\n<h5>Combinations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF found convincing evidence that combinations of behavioral plus pharmacotherapy interventions substantially increase achievement of smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of combined interventions are small. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of providing combined interventions for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults is substantial.\r\n<h5>ENDS</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF concludes that the current evidence on the use of ENDS for conventional smoking cessation is insufficient. Evidence is lacking and conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Given the established safety and effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions, the USPSTF recommends that primary care providers direct patients who smoke to these other interventions.\r\n<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>\r\n<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions (such as behavioral counseling, feedback, health education, incentives, and social support) substantially improve achievement of smoking cessation in pregnant women, increase birthweight, and decrease preterm birth in their children. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that there are no harms of behavioral interventions and concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of providing behavioral interventions for smoking cessation in pregnant women is substantial.\r\n<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>\r\nThe USPSTF concludes that the current evidence on pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in pregnant women is insufficient. Evidence on NRT is limited and conflicting, evidence on other forms of pharmacotherapy is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.\r\n<h3><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 5 May to 1 June 2015. Several comments requested clarification about which types of interventions are being recommended&mdash;pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, or combinations of both. Several comments also expressed concern that the draft language for the recommendation may cause clinicians to offer only 1 type of intervention. The USPSTF clarified that both intervention types (pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions) are effective and recommended; combinations of interventions are most effective, and all should be offered. The best and most effective combinations are those that are acceptable to and feasible for an individual patient. Clinicians should consider the patient&rsquo;s specific medical history and preferences and offer and provide the combination that works best for that patient. Comments also sought clarification about which populations are included in the I statement for ENDS; the USPSTF clarified that the I statement for ENDS includes pregnant women. A few comments requested additional implementation resources. The USPSTF revised the recommendation to include a table that highlights effective components of behavioral interventions and provided links to additional resources on pharmacotherapy options and resources for pregnant women. The USPSTF revised its language on ENDS to reflect current terminology.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nBecause of the well-established health benefits of smoking cessation,&nbsp;most of the research on interventions for smoking cessation focuses on cessation (rather than health outcomes) as a primary outcome. The current review identified 1 study of middle-aged men at high risk for cardiorespiratory disease that found a significantly smaller number of deaths from respiratory illness at 33 years of follow-up in participants who received advice from medical practitioners. The study also found favorable effects on all-cause mortality, coronary disease mortality, and lung cancer incidence and mortality at 20 years of follow-up, although these effects were not significant.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Updates of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nIn 2009, the USPSTF recommended that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide interventions for smoking cessation for those who use tobacco products (A recommendation). It also recommended that clinicians ask all pregnant women about tobacco use and provide augmented, pregnancy-tailored counseling for those who smoke (A recommendation). The current recommendation updates and is consistent with the 2009 recommendation. In addition, the USPSTF reviewed evidence on ENDS, an emerging tobacco product, but found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against its use for smoking cessation. The USPSTF also reviewed updated evidence on pharmacotherapy interventions for smoking cessation in pregnant women and found that the evidence is still insufficient to make a recommendation.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)D] (the major form of vitamin D that circulates in the body). Depending on which cut point is used (usually &lt;50 or &lt;75 nmol/L [&lt;20 or &lt;30 ng/mL]), some studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D are associated with increased risk for fractures, functional limitations, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and death.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>Many testing methods are available that measure total serum 25-(OH)D levels. However, the accuracy of these tests to detect vitamin D deficiency is difficult to determine because of the lack of studies that use an internationally recognized reference standard and the lack of consensus on the laboratory values that define vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF found evidence suggesting that results vary by testing method and between laboratories using the same testing methods.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct benefit of screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency has no benefit on cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, risk for death in community-dwelling adults, and risk for fractures in persons not selected on the basis of being at high risk for fractures. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefit of treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency on other outcomes, including psychosocial and physical functioning. Although the evidence is adequate for a few limited outcomes, the overall evidence on the early treatment of asymptomatic, screen-detected vitamin D deficiency in adults to improve overall health outcomes is inadequate.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of treatment of vitamin D deficiency are small to none. No studies reporting on the harms of treatment of vitamin D deficiency identified a significant increase in total adverse events, hypercalcemia, kidney stones, or gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults to improve health outcomes is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening and early intervention cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended. This recommendation focuses on screening (that is, testing for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults and treating those who are found to have a deficiency), which is different from other USPSTF recommendation statements on supplementation (that is, recommending preventive medication for patients at increased risk for a specific negative health outcome, such as falls, regardless of whether they have a deficiency).<br><br>The USPSTF recognizes that there is no consensus on how to define vitamin D deficiency and does not endorse the use of a specific threshold to identify it. The evidence reviewed by the USPSTF used varying cut points. For the purposes of this recommendation statement, the term &ldquo;vitamin D deficiency&rdquo; is used to reflect evidence from study populations generally representing total serum 25-(OH)D levels of 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) or less or subpopulations of studies with levels less than 50 nmol/L (&lt;20 ng/mL).\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nGiven the lack of consensus on how to define and assess vitamin D deficiency, its precise prevalence estimates are difficult to determine. To collect precise estimates, accurate assay methods, an internationally recognized reference standard, and a specific cut point for defining vitamin D deficiency need to be established. Reported estimates of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency vary widely depending on the period, cut point, study population, study design, and testing method. Estimates range from as low as 19% using a statistical modeling approach&nbsp;to as high as 77% based on NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from 2001 to 2004 (using a cut point of &lt;75 nmol/L [&lt;30 ng/mL]).<br><br>The effect of vitamin D levels on health outcomes is difficult to evaluate. Lower vitamin D levels have been reported to increase risk for fractures, falls, functional limitations, some types of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and death. However, observations of these associations are inconsistent and may vary by the cut point used to define low vitamin D levels and by subpopulation (defined by race or institutionalization). For example, African Americans have paradoxically lower reported rates of fractures despite having increased prevalence of low vitamin D levels than white persons.<br><br>If a threshold total serum 25-(OH)D level could be established to define vitamin D deficiency and if testing assays could be standardized, the goal of screening for vitamin D deficiency would be to identify and treat it before associated adverse clinical outcomes occur. However, current evidence is inadequate to determine whether screening for and treatment of asymptomatic low 25-(OH)D levels improve clinical outcomes in community-dwelling adults.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nScreening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of the uncertainty about the cut point for defining deficiency and the variability of available testing assays. Misclassification may result in overdiagnosis (which may lead to nondeficient persons receiving unnecessary treatment) or underdiagnosis (which may lead to deficient persons not receiving treatment).<br><br>A rare but potential harm of treatment with oral vitamin D is toxicity, which may lead to hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, suppressed parathyroid hormone, and hypercalciuria. However, the 25-(OH)D level associated with toxicity (often defined as &gt;500 nmol/L [&gt;200 ng/mL])&nbsp;is well above the level considered to be sufficient. Treatment with vitamin D plus calcium may also be associated with increased risk for kidney stones; vitamin D alone does not seem to increase this risk. In general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms. Treatment with increased sun exposure (specifically ultraviolet B [UVB] radiation) may increase risk for skin cancer. Because of this concern, increased sun exposure is generally not recommended as treatment of vitamin D deficiency.\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\nSeveral vitamin D testing methods are available; the cost of screening varies.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nTesting rates for vitamin D levels seem to be increasing, despite the uncertainty about the definition of deficiency. Although estimates of screening rates in primary care settings are not available, a recent study evaluating data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey found that the annual rate of outpatient visits associated with a diagnosis code for vitamin D deficiency more than tripled between 2008 and 2010 (1177 visits per 100,000 population in 2010).&nbsp;In addition, according to a 2009 survey, total serum 25-(OH)D testing increased by at least 50% compared with the previous year in more than half of the clinical laboratories surveyed.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nAlthough there is not enough evidence to support screening for vitamin D deficiency, some evidence suggests factors that may increase risk for vitamin D deficiency. Persons with low vitamin D intake, decreased vitamin D absorption, and little or no sun exposure (for example, due to the winter season, high latitude, or physical sun avoidance) may be at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;Obesity and darker skin pigmentation may also be associated with low levels of total serum 25-(OH)D, but whether these factors reflect vitamin D deficiency or increase the risk for adverse clinical outcomes is unclear. Obesity may allow for greater sequestration of vitamin D into adipose tissue; however, this vitamin D may still be bioavailable.&nbsp;Increased skin pigmentation reduces the skin's ability to produce vitamin D in response to UVB exposure. Prevalence rates of low total serum 25-(OH)D are 2 to 9 times higher in African Americans and 2 to 3 times higher in Hispanics than in white persons,&nbsp;yet the risk for fractures in African Americans is half that in white persons.&nbsp;Other factors, such as body composition and calcium economy, have been proposed to explain this paradox;&nbsp;however, a recent study suggests that although total serum 25-(OH)D levels in African Americans may be low, the concentration of bioavailable 25-(OH)D may not be.&nbsp;Some evidence suggests that older age and female sex may also be associated with increased risk for vitamin D deficiency; however, these findings are inconsistent.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nCurrent vitamin D assays measure total serum 25-(OH)D levels to determine vitamin D status (that is, whether a person is considered to have or not have a deficiency). Many testing methods are available, including competitive protein binding, immunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography, and combined high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are unknown because of the lack of studies that use an internationally recognized reference standard. Variability between assay methods and between laboratories using the same methods may range from 10% to 20%, and classification of samples as &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; or &ldquo;nondeficient&rdquo; may vary by 4% to 32%, depending on which assay is used.&nbsp;Another factor that may complicate interpretation is that 25-(OH)D may act as a negative acute-phase reactant and its levels may decrease in response to inflammation. Lastly, whether common laboratory reference ranges are appropriate for all ethnic groups is unclear.\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\nOral vitamin D is most often used to treat vitamin D deficiency; other treatment options include increasing dietary vitamin D intake or UVB exposure. Commonly available forms of oral vitamin D include vitamin D3&nbsp;(cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2&nbsp;(ergocalciferol).\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine, daily dietary vitamin D intake of 600 IU in adults aged 18 to 70 years and 800 IU in adults older than 70 years should be sufficient to meet the needs of 97.5% of the adult population.&nbsp;Ultraviolet B exposure may also increase vitamin D levels; however, several variables (such as the time of day, season, cloud cover, skin pigmentation, and sunscreen use) can affect the length of exposure needed to attain sufficient vitamin D levels. Sun exposure to prevent vitamin D deficiency is not generally recommended because it increases the risk for skin cancer associated with UVB radiation.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has published recommendations on the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of falls and fractures and vitamin supplementation for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). These recommendations differ from the current recommendation statement in that they address vitamin D supplementation in certain populations at high risk for falls, fractures, cardiovascular disease, or cancer without first determining a patient's vitamin D status.\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nThe lack of an accurate screening strategy to identify vitamin D deficiency, especially in important subpopulations (such as African Americans), is a critical gap in the evidence. Further research is needed to determine the cut point that defines vitamin D deficiency, the sensitivity and specificity of various assays using an internationally accepted reference standard, and whether total serum 25-(OH)D is the best measure of vitamin D deficiency in all populations. The possible effects of acute inflammation on vitamin D levels also needs further investigation. More studies are also needed to evaluate which treatment regimens may benefit specific vitamin D&ndash;deficient populations, such as men and non-Caucasian ethnic groups, who are absent from the evidence base. Lastly, further studies are needed to evaluate the harms of screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency. One ongoing trial, VITAL (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL), may provide some answers in the near future. This large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is designed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a multiethnic study population. Furthermore, because a large portion of the study population will have baseline 25-(OH)D levels measured, the study may provide information on whether supplementation in vitamin D&ndash;deficient populations is beneficial.",

      "other": "No national primary care professional organization currently recommends population-wide screening for vitamin D deficiency. The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;The Endocrine Society recommends screening for vitamin D deficiency only in persons at risk and states that there is no evidence showing benefits of screening at a population level.&nbsp;It defines vitamin D deficiency as total serum 25-(OH)D levels of less than 50 nmol/L (&lt;20 ng/mL) and vitamin D insufficiency as 52.5 to 72.5 nmol/L (21 to 29 ng/mL) and recommends treatment of persons with a vitamin D deficiency. Other organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,&nbsp;the American Geriatric Society,&nbsp;and the National Osteoporosis Foundation,&nbsp;recommend testing for vitamin D as part of osteoporosis management or falls prevention. The Institute of Medicine does not have formal guidelines on screening for vitamin D deficiency, but it has published a report on the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D.&nbsp;The RDA is the estimated requirement to meet or exceed the vitamin D needs of 97.5% of the adult population. Assuming minimal sun exposure, the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s RDA for vitamin D is 600 IU/day for adults aged 19 to 70 years and 800 IU/day for adults older than 70 years. Furthermore, it concluded that total serum 25-(OH)D levels of 40 nmol/L (16 ng/mL) meet the needs of approximately half of the population, and levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or greater meet the needs of nearly all of the population. However, it is not necessary to evaluate 25-(OH)D levels before discussing RDA with patients.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps regulate calcium homeostasis and bone health. Important sources of vitamin D include diet (such as fatty fish, cod liver oil, dairy products, fortified beverages and foods, and supplements) and endogenous synthesis triggered by UVB exposure. Inadequate dietary vitamin D intake, decreased vitamin D absorption, and limited UVB exposure can all decrease vitamin D levels, but the exact threshold that defines vitamin D deficiency is not well-established. Furthermore, the association between vitamin D status and health outcomes is unclear. <br><br>Severe and prolonged vitamin D deficiency can cause bone mineralization diseases, such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Other health effects caused by more moderate decreases in vitamin D levels, which were the focus of the current evidence review, are difficult to determine. Studies have evaluated the association between vitamin D status and health outcomes, such as fractures, falls, cancer, cardiovascular disease, death, functional limitations, diabetes, and depression. Results have varied depending on the cut point used to define deficiency, population, and setting.&nbsp;Overall, studies have suggested a decreased risk for colorectal cancer with higher 25-(OH)D levels and either an inverse or a U-shaped relationship with mortality. Studies on risk for fractures, falls, and cardiovascular disease have been less consistent; most often, white populations showed an increased risk for fractures and cardiovascular disease, and institutionalized populations showed an increased risk for falls. Few studies have evaluated associations with functional limitations, diabetes, or depression, but these studies have generally suggested an increased risk with lower 25-(OH)D levels. <br><br>Childhood rickets has become relatively rare in the United States since vitamin D&ndash;fortified milk was introduced in the 1930s. Prevalence rates of less clinically overt vitamin D deficiency are much more difficult to characterize given the uncertainty about how to define adequate levels of vitamin D and which cut point defines deficiency. In addition, the lack of a reference standard for vitamin D testing until recently has further complicated accurate measurement of vitamin D deficiency prevalence rates. <br><br>A recent study using a statistical probability approach estimated that 19% of the U.S. population is at risk for vitamin D inadequacy.&nbsp;On the basis of NHANES data, 33% of the U.S. population had 25-(OH)D levels at 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or less from 2001 to 2006&nbsp;and 77% had levels less than 75 nmol/L (&lt;30 ng/mL) from 2001 to 2004. <br><br>Commonly reported risk factors for low 25-(OH)D levels are decreased dietary vitamin D intake, absorption, or synthesis due to decreased sun exposure or darker skin pigmentation; older age; inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorptive conditions, or history of gastric bypass; being homebound or institutionalized; routinely wearing clothing that prevents sun exposure on most of the skin; and living at high latitudes. <br><br>Populations with darker skin pigmentation, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, have been found to have lower 25-(OH)D levels than white populations. According to the Second National Report on Biochemical Indicators of Diet and Nutrition in the U.S. Population (based on NHANES data from 2003 to 2006), 21.7% of white persons had 25-(OH)D levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or less compared with 70.6% of African Americans and 44.2% of Hispanics; further, the geometric mean of 25-(OH)D levels in adults aged 20 years or older ranged from 57.5 to 64 nmol/L (23.0 to 25.6 ng/mL) in white persons, 32.5 to 36.25 nmol/L (13.0 to 14.5 ng/mL) in African Americans, and 44.5 to 46.5 nmol/L (17.8 to 18.6 ng/mL) in Hispanics. However, it is unclear if low 25-(OH)D levels are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in these populations. For example, the increased risk for fractures and cardiovascular disease observed in some studies of white persons has not been found in African Americans.&nbsp; A recent study suggests that although total serum 25-(OH)D levels may be lower in African Americans than in white persons, the concentration of bioavailable 25-(OH)D may be similar between the 2 populations when vitamin D&ndash;binding protein is considered.&nbsp;If substantiated, this finding could potentially explain why higher rates of low total serum 25-(OH)D levels have been reported in African Americans without an associated risk for fractures and question the use of total serum 25-(OH)D measurements to identify vitamin D deficiency in all populations. <br><br>Populations with obesity have been found to have lower 25-(OH)D levels; however, this may be due to either increased vitamin D requirements or greater sequestration of vitamin D into adipose tissue. It is not clear whether low 25-(OH)D levels in persons who are obese are associated with negative clinical outcomes.<br>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThis is a new topic for the USPSTF. The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment. The review focused on community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who do not have clinical signs of vitamin D deficiency or conditions that could cause vitamin D deficiency and were seen in primary care settings. Populations with certain conditions, such as (but not limited to) bone, endocrine, or autoimmune diseases were excluded because vitamin D testing in these populations could be considered management of a condition rather than general screening. Similarly, because of the unique and increased nutritional demands during pregnancy, vitamin D testing in pregnant women is considered outside the scope of general screening. Although breastfeeding women were not excluded, the review identified no studies of breastfeeding women that met inclusion criteria. For treatment, the review included only oral vitamin D formulations; treatment with nonoral vitamin D therapies or UVB exposure was excluded.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nDespite the availability of many tests that measure total serum 25-(OH)D levels, their sensitivities and specificities are currently unknown given the lack of studies that use an internationally recognized, commutable reference standard. In addition, determining the accuracy of 25-(OH)D assays is complicated by an unclear understanding of how consistently (within a given assay and between assays) 25-(OH)D is displaced from vitamin D&ndash;binding protein to be measured and the effect of possible interference from other heterophilic antibodies that may bind and cause inaccurate measurements.&nbsp;Studies report testing variability between methods and between laboratories using the same method and that classification of patient samples as deficient or nondeficient can vary by 4% to 32%, depending on which assay is used. <br><br>Recognizing the need for standardization of vitamin D measurement, a few organizations recently initiated programs to improve testing accuracy. The National Institute of Standards and Technology developed a standard reference material for 25-(OH)D in 2009 that seems to improve testing accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, but it has limited effects on improving accuracy of immunoassay methods. Since 2010, the Vitamin D Standardization Program&nbsp;has sought to standardize the laboratory measurement of vitamin D status through international collaboration and coordination and has developed standardized procedures for measuring total serum 25-(OH)D for the NHANES. However, these protocols are not yet available for commercial or research laboratory use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers the Vitamin D Standardization Certification Program, which is a nonregulatory program that helps laboratories maintain and enhance the quality and comparability of measurement results.&nbsp;Several external accuracy-based testing systems are available for commercial and research laboratory use, such as the Vitamin D Metabolites Quality Assurance Program (established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Institutes of Health) and the Vitamin D External Quality Assurance Scheme.<br><br>In addition to the uncertain accuracy of total serum 25-(OH)D tests, it is unclear if total serum 25-(OH)D is the best indicator of vitamin D status or if bioavailable 25-(OH)D should be used instead. As noted previously, a 2013 study found that although African American study participants had lower total serum 25-(OH)D levels than white study participants, both groups had similar concentrations of bioavailable 25-(OH)D. This study highlights the difficulty of using a universal total serum 25-(OH)D cut point to define deficiency across different races. However, more research is needed before this can be confirmed, and commercial testing of bioavailable 25-(OH)D levels is not currently available.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nOverall, the USPSTF reviewed 16 trials and 1 nested case&ndash;control study that evaluated the effects of treatment of vitamin D deficiency on health outcomes in populations not selected on the basis of signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;In general, studies included older adults (most studies had a mean study age &gt;65 years) who were predominantly women (12 studies included women only) and community-dwelling, although 4 studies were conducted in exclusively institutionalized settings. All studies were done in the United States or Europe, with most conducted exclusively in Europe. Studies used vitamin D3&nbsp;in doses of 400 to 4800 IU/day or 8400 to 50,000 IU/week, and 5 studies included treatment with calcium. Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 7 years.<br><br>No studies directly assessed the effectiveness of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF identified 17 studies that assessed the effectiveness of oral vitamin D treatment on various health outcomes (such as death, falls, fractures, cancer, diabetes, and physical and psychosocial functioning) in participants with vitamin D deficiency who were not selected on the basis of signs or symptoms of deficiency.&nbsp;Three studies conducted in Europe reported results suggesting a benefit on mortality in older institutionalized patients who were treated for vitamin D deficiency. However, meta-analysis of 8 studies limited to community-dwelling populations showed no benefit.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-deficiency-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Studies on vitamin D treatment and falls reported mixed results. Five studies evaluated the effect of treatment of vitamin D deficiency on risk for fractures, and no studies, either individually or aggregated in meta-analysis, found a benefit on fracture risk.&nbsp;Few studies evaluated the effect of treatment of vitamin D deficiency on risk for cancer or diabetes or physical or psychosocial functioning, but they generally reported no association.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo studies directly assessed the harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF identified 24 studies&nbsp;that reported on the adverse effects of vitamin D treatment; however, most trials were not designed to assess harms, and reporting of adverse events was generally suboptimal. Study participants were predominantly women, although 2 studies were done exclusively in men. The mean age of study participants ranged from 31 to 85 years, and most studies were conducted in Europe. Five studies were conducted exclusively in institutionalized settings. Vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 7000 IU/day and 8400 to 54,000 IU/week, and 5 studies included treatment with vitamin D and calcium. Follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 4 years.<br><br>No significant difference in rates of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events was reported by any study, either individually or aggregated in meta-analysis.&nbsp;Seventeen trials evaluated the risk for hypercalcemia with vitamin D treatment. No individual studies reported a significantly higher incidence of hypercalcemia; overall, 1.7% of treated participants versus 1.3% of control participants had hypercalcemia in trials that reported at least 1 case of hypercalcemia. However, the overall number of cases of hypercalcemia was low, and 7 trials reported no cases. Seven trials reported on risk for kidney stones, 2 of which included treatment with vitamin D and calcium; none reported kidney stones in any participants.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nOverall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for and early treatment of vitamin D deficiency in community-dwelling, U.S. primary care adult populations. No studies specifically evaluated the effect of screening on health outcomes or the treatment of screen-detected vitamin D deficiency. Studies on treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency used varying testing methods, cut points for vitamin D deficiency, and treatment regimens. Furthermore, most studies were conducted in elderly white (mostly European) and predominantly female populations; thus, applying the evidence to screening in the general U.S. primary care population is difficult. The harms of early treatment of vitamin D deficiency are small to none, and the evidence on the harms of screening is inadequate. Despite the absence of proven harms of screening, the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to determine that the benefits of screening outweigh the potential harms. <br><br>The USPSTF found evidence suggesting considerable variation in the way vitamin D is measured and great uncertainty about the specific vitamin D level that determines when treatment with vitamin D would improve health. Furthermore, information is lacking on how to measure and treat vitamin D deficiency in specific subpopulations, such as men, nonwhite ethnic groups, persons who are obese, and less elderly populations. On the basis of the current available science, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for vitamin D deficiency to improve health outcomes is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening and early intervention cannot be determined.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 24 June to 21 July 2014. Several comments requested that the scope of the recommendation be expanded to include special populations, such as those with bone, endocrine, and immune conditions. The USPSTF clarified the recommendation to better explain to which populations it applies and why other populations were not included. A few comments also requested information on risk assessment tools that could be used to stratify patients into high versus low risk for vitamin D deficiency before testing. The systematic review did not evaluate the evidence on risk assessment tools; however, the USPSTF may consider looking at this information in future updates of the topic. Comments also provided information on additional factors that complicate interpretation of vitamin D tests; the USPSTF added discussion of these factors to the Clinical Considerations and Discussion sections.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Speech and language delays and disorders can pose significant problems for children and their families. Children with speech and language delays develop speech or language in the correct sequence but at a slower rate than expected, whereas children with speech and language disorders develop speech or language that is qualitatively different from typical development. Differentiating between delays and disorders can be complicated. First, screening instruments have difficulty distinguishing between the two. Second, although the majority of school-aged children with language disorders present with language delays as toddlers, some children outgrow their language delay. <br><br>Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is limited. In 2007, about 2.6% of children ages 3 to 5 years received services for speech and language disabilities under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In 1 population-based study in 8-year-olds in Utah, the prevalence of children with communication disorders (speech or language) on the basis of special education or&nbsp;<em>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</em>, classifications was 63.4 cases per 1,000 children.&nbsp;The prevalence of isolated communication disorders (i.e., children without a concomitant diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability) was 59.1 cases per 1,000 children.<br><br>Information on the natural history of speech and language delays and disorders, including how outcomes may change as a result of screening or treatment, is also limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of screening instruments for speech and language delay for use in primary care settings.

      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies only to asymptomatic children whose parents or clinicians do not have specific concerns about their speech, language, hearing, or development. It does not apply to children whose parents or clinicians raise those concerns; these children should undergo evaluation and, if needed, treatment.<br><br>This recommendation discusses the identification and treatment of &ldquo;primary&rdquo; speech and language delays and disorders (i.e., in children who have not been previously identified with another disorder or disability that may cause speech or language impairment].\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nInformation about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is limited. In 2007, about 2.6% of children ages 3 to 5 years received services for speech and language disabilities under IDEA. <br><br>Childhood speech and language disorders include a broad set of disorders with heterogeneous outcomes. Information about the natural history of these disorders is limited, because most affected children receive at least some type of intervention. However, there is some evidence that young children with speech and language delay may be at increased risk of language-based learning disabilities.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nThe potential harms of screening and interventions for speech and language disorders in young children in primary care include the time, effort, and anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screen, as well as the potential detriments associated with diagnostic labeling. However, the USPSTF found no studies on these harms.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nSurveillance or screening for speech and language disorders is commonly recommended as part of routine developmental surveillance and screening in primary care settings (i.e., during well-child visits).&nbsp;In practice, however, such screening is not universal. The previous evidence review&nbsp;found that 55% of parents reported that their toddler did not receive any type of developmental assessment at their well-child visit, and 30% of parents reported that their child&rsquo;s health care provider had not discussed with them how their child communicates.&nbsp;In a 2009 study, approximately half of responding pediatricians reported that they &ldquo;always or almost always&rdquo; use a standardized screening tool to detect developmental problems in young children; about 40% of respondents reported using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ).&nbsp;The USPSTF distinguishes between screening in primary care settings and diagnostic testing, which may occur in other settings.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nBased on a review of 31 cohort studies, several risk factors have been reported to be associated with speech and language delay and disorders, including male sex, family history of speech and language impairment, low parental education level, and perinatal risk factors (e.g., prematurity, low birth weight, and birth difficulties).\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found inadequate evidence on specific screening tests for use in primary care. Widely used screening tests in the United States include the ASQ, the Language Development Survey (LDS), and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CD).<br>\r\n<h3>Interventions</h3>\r\nInterventions for childhood speech and language disorders vary widely and can include speech-language therapy sessions and assistive technology (if indicated). Interventions are commonly individualized to each child&rsquo;s specific pattern of symptoms, needs, interests, personality, and learning style. Treatment plans also incorporate the priorities of the child, parents, and/or teachers. Speech-language therapy may take place in various settings, such as speech and language specialty clinics, the school or classroom, and the home. Therapy may be administered on an individual basis and/or in groups, and may be child-centered and/or include peer and family components. Therapists may be speech-language pathologists, educators, or parents. The duration and intensity of the intervention depend on the severity of the speech or language disorder and the child&rsquo;s progress in meeting therapy goals.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for hearing loss in all newborn infants (B recommendation). The USPSTF is developing a recommendation on screening for autism spectrum disorder in young children. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nAll states have designated programs that offer evaluation and intervention services to children ages 0 to 5 years. IDEA is a law that ensures early intervention, special education, and related services for children with disabilities in the United States. Infants and toddlers (birth to age 2 years) with disabilities and their families may receive early intervention services under IDEA part C, whereas children and adolescents (ages 3 to 21 years) may receive special education and related services under IDEA part B.\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF identified several evidence gaps, including a critical need for studies specifically designed and executed to address whether systematic, routine screening for speech and language delay and disorders in young children in primary care settings leads to improved speech, language, or other outcomes. Studies on the feasibility of speech- and language-specific screening as part of routine developmental screening and that identify the most effective screening instruments are needed. Studies on the potential harms of screening and interventions are also needed. <br><br>Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is lacking. More information about the specific factors associated with intervention effectiveness, including the potential effects of age at diagnosis, age at treatment, treatment type, and treatment duration, is needed. <br><br>&nbsp;",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nAccording to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, speech sound disorders affect 10% of children. The estimated prevalence of language difficulty in preschool-aged children is between 2% and 19%. Specific language impairment is one of the most common childhood disorders, affecting 7% of children. More than 2 million Americans stutter, half of whom are children. <br><br>Childhood speech and language disorders include a broad set of disorders with heterogeneous outcomes. Young children with speech and language delay may be at increased risk of learning disabilities once they reach school age.&nbsp;Children with speech sound disorders or language impairment are at greatest risk of being diagnosed with a literacy disability,&nbsp;including difficulty with reading in grade school&nbsp;and/or with written language. <br><br>The risk of poor outcomes is greater for children whose disorders persist past the early childhood years and for those who have lower IQ scores and language impairments rather than only speech impairments.&nbsp;Children who are diagnosed with language delays may have more problems with behavior and psychosocial adjustment, which may persist into adulthood.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nTo update its 2006 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children aged 5 years or younger. The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of screening in primary care settings, as well as the role of surveillance (active monitoring) by primary care clinicians to identify children for further diagnostic evaluation and interventions for speech and language delays and disorders. The USPSTF also evaluated evidence on whether screening and interventions for speech and language delay and disorders lead to improved speech, language, or other outcomes, as well as the potential harms associated with screening and interventions. <br><br>The evidence review focused on speech and language delays and disorders with a &ldquo;primary&rdquo; or developmental etiology. That is, the review was limited to studies in children who had not been previously identified with another disorder or disability that may cause speech or language impairment. The review excluded studies that focused on acquired, focal causes of speech and language delay. Although abnormal speech and language development may be associated with autism spectrum disorder, this review did not evaluate screening for autism spectrum disorder. The USPSTF is currently reviewing the evidence on screening for autism spectrum disorder for a separate recommendation statement. <br><br>The evidence review focused on studies conducted in children aged 5 years or younger in which any child who screened positive received formal diagnostic assessment for speech and language delays and disorders by 6 years of age. Studies of treatment and/or intervention outcomes were not restricted by age at treatment but focused primarily on toddlers and preschool-aged children. <br><br>The evidence review included randomized, controlled trials and other systematic reviews, as well as cohort studies of screening and surveillance for speech and language delays and disorders. The USPSTF focused on screening instruments specific to speech and language conditions, as well as more general developmental screening tools with speech and language components. All tools needed to be feasible for use in primary care or the results had to be interpretable within a primary care setting. For surveillance studies, the USPSTF considered processes of monitoring speech and language in primary care settings rather than formal screening instruments. Screening and surveillance studies had to be conducted or results had to be interpretable in primary care settings. In contrast, treatment studies were not limited by study setting, which included speech and language clinics, schools, and/or home settings. <br><br>The current review differed somewhat from the previous review in that it focused on screening tools that can be administered within the usual length of a primary care visit (&le;10 minutes) or those that require more than 10 minutes and are administered outside of a primary care setting, if the results can be readily interpreted by a primary care clinician. The current review also focused on studies in patients without known causes of speech and language delay (because these are the patients most likely to be identified through screening]]<br>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF identified 24 studies (5 good- and 19 fair-quality)<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/speech-and-language-delay-and-disorders-in-children-age-5-and-younger-screening#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;that evaluated the accuracy of 20 different screening tools. The majority of studies included 2- and 3-year-olds, but the ages varied. Recruitment techniques and venues included advertisements, birth registries, early childhood programs, university research programs, medical practices, and school registration and entrance medical examinations.<br><br> The USPSTF considered 7 parent-administered screening tools: the ASQ, the General Language Screen (formerly known as the Parent Language Checklist), the Infant-Toddler Checklist, the LDS, the CDI, the Speech and Language Parent Questionnaire, and the Ward Infant Language Screening Test, Assessment, Acceleration, and Remediation. The USPSTF considered 13 screening tools administered by professionals or paraprofessionals: the Battelle Developmental Inventory, the BRIGANCE Preschool Screen, the Davis Observation Checklist for Texas, the Denver Articulation Screening Exam, DENVER II (formerly the Denver Developmental Screening Test), a standard developmental screen administered by nurses, Early Screening Profiles, the Fluharty Preschool Speech and Language Screening Test, the Northwestern Syntax Screening Test, the Screening Kit of Language Development, the Sentence Repetition Screening Test, the Structured Screening Test (formerly known as the Hackney Early Language Screening Test), and Rigby&rsquo;s trial speech screening test.<br><br>Test performance characteristics varied widely. Parent-administered screening tools generally performed better than other tools. Among parent-administered tools, sensitivity was generally higher for the CDI, the Infant-Toddler Checklist, and the LDS. Specificity was comparable across the CDI, the LDS, and the ASQ.<br><br>The applicability of the evidence to screening in primary care is limited by several factors. Most studies focused on prescreened populations with a relatively high prevalence of language delays and disabilities (usually &gt;10%). The USPSTF found it difficult to compare the performance of individual screening tools across populations because individual studies used different tools and outcome measures in different populations and settings. Included studies used well-regarded instruments used by speech-language pathologists as reference standards; however, individual studies used different reference standards. In addition to small sample sizes, some studies were conducted in countries with health care systems that are not comparable with that of the United States.<br><br>The USPSTF identified no studies on the accuracy of surveillance of speech and language development by primary care clinicians.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Interventions</h3>\r\nThe review for the USPSTF identified 1 poor-quality randomized, controlled trial of screening for language delays in children ages 18 and 24 months that followed outcomes at ages 3 and 8 years.&nbsp;This cluster-randomized trial and follow-up study was conducted in 9,419 children at 55 child health centers in 6 geographic regions of The Netherlands. Outcomes included the percentage of children who attended a special school, percentage who repeated a class because of language problems, and percentage who scored low on standardized language tests. The authors concluded that screening toddlers for language delay reduces requirements for special education and leads to improved language performance at age 8 years. However, the study was rated as poor quality, and therefore not included in the USPSTF&rsquo;s deliberation, because of several limitations, including the following: suboptimal rates of screening and low retention of trial subjects, reliance on indirect measures of speech and language outcomes in school-aged children (instead of individualized testing), lack of blinding to screening or treatment status by teachers and parents who assessed outcomes, and lack of adjustment for other potential reasons for placement in special education. <br><br>The USPSTF identified 13 fair- or good-quality studies on the potential benefits of treatment interventions for children diagnosed with specific speech and language delays and disorders that reported inconsistent findings on speech and language outcomes.&nbsp;The majority of the trials reported improvements in speech and language measures. However, the applicability of this evidence to routine screening in a primary care setting is limited, because many of the studies were conducted in very high risk populations (i.e., high-prevalence populations]] In addition, these studies did not report treatment effectiveness in children whose speech and language delay had actually been detected by screening; instead, the delays had often been identified as a result of parent or teacher concerns. A majority of the intervention studies were conducted outside of the United States, which could also limit the applicability of findings. <br><br>The USPSTF identified 4 fair- or good-quality studies that reported inconsistent findings on other outcomes, including socialization, reading comprehension, parental stress, and child well-being or attention level.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Interventions</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF identified no studies on the potential harms of screening in primary care settings for speech and language delays and disorders, such as labeling or anxiety. The USPSTF identified 2 studies (1 fair- and 1 good-quality) on the potential harms of treatment that reported inconsistent findings.&nbsp;The treatment group of 1 study reported reduced parental stress, whereas another study reported no effect on child well-being or attention level. Treatment harms were generally not measured or reported; the 2 included studies reported few data on a limited number of outcomes.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of screening or surveillance for speech and language delay and disorders in primary care settings. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the potential benefits of screening in primary care settings and treatment on speech, language, or other outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment is associated with improvements in some speech and language measures, but inadequate evidence on its effectiveness in screen-detected children. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association between treatment and outcomes other than speech and language. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the potential harms of screening in primary care settings and treatment for speech and language delay and disorders. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening in primary care settings for speech and language delays and disorders in young children cannot be determined.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted on the USPSTF Web site from November 18 to December 15, 2014. In response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified that this recommendation applies only to asymptomatic children whose parents or clinicians do not have specific concerns about their speech, language, hearing, or development. The USPSTF also emphasized that this recommendation applies only to screening in primary care settings, and it noted the distinction between screening in primary care settings and diagnostic testing, which may occur in other settings. The USPSTF also noted that this recommendation does not evaluate screening for autism spectrum disorder, which the Task Force will address in a separate recommendation statement. The USPSTF also called for research on socioeconomic and other factors associated with risks, assessment, and management of speech and language delay and disorders in children.\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nThis recommendation replaces the 2006 USPSTF recommendation on screening for speech and language delay in preschool-aged children. The current recommendation is consistent with the previous recommendation, which concluded that the evidence on the routine use of brief, formal screening instruments in primary care settings to detect speech and language delay in children aged 5 years or younger is insufficient.",

      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation addresses screening and supplementation in pregnant women and adolescents living in the United States who do not have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. It does not address pregnant women who are malnourished, have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia, or have special hematologic conditions or nutritional needs that may increase their need for iron. Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children is addressed in a separate recommendation statement (available at<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nBased on older data, estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in the United States range from 2% to 27%, with higher rates in later trimesters and minority populations.&nbsp;Based on calculations of total body iron from 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women is 18.6%; of these, 16.2% also have anemia.&nbsp;However, given the physiologic hemodilution that normally occurs during the later stages of pregnancy, determining exact prevalence rates of anemia in pregnant women may be difficult.<br><br>Several factors have been identified that may increase a pregnant woman&rsquo;s risk for iron deficiency anemia, including a diet lacking in iron-rich foods (for example, a vegetarian diet with inadequate sources of iron), gastrointestinal disease and/or medications that can decrease iron absorption (for example, antacids), and a short interval between pregnancies. Non-Hispanic black and Mexican American women have higher prevalence rates of iron deficiency than white women and women with parity of 2 or more. Evidence on additional risk factors, such as lower educational level and family income, has been less consistent. On the basis of a literature scan, the USPSTF found limited evidence on the use of risk prediction tools to identify pregnant women who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.<br><br>&nbsp;Many observational studies have explored the association between adverse maternal and infant health outcomes (such as postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, low birthweight, and perinatal death) and iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy, but findings have been inconclusive.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nThe harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia have not been well-studied but are likely minor. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. Reported adverse events of iron supplementation or treatment with iron include limited gastrointestinal symptoms, darkening color of urine or stool, staining of teeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nRates of screening for iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation in pregnant women by clinicians are not well-documented. However, based on anecdotal evidence, it is probably common. In addition, there may be other reasons to screen for anemia in pregnant women, such as to prepare for cesarean delivery or anticipated blood loss during a complicated delivery. Older data from 1988 show that 97% of pregnant women who received prenatal care reported being advised to take a multivitamin&ndash;mineral supplement.&nbsp;Based on 1996 to 2006 NHANES data, 77% of pregnant women reported using a supplement within the previous 30 days and they most frequently used a multivitamin containing 48 mg of iron.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nMeasurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit levels is often the first step used in primary care practice.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nTreatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant women and includes additional iron intake through oral iron pills, prenatal vitamins, and diet. The usual dose is 60 to 120 mg of elemental iron per day.&nbsp;Intravenous iron treatment is also used during pregnancy.\r\n<h3>Supplementation</h3>\r\nPrenatal vitamins often include a low dose of iron; the usual dose prescribed in early pregnancy is 30 mg of elemental iron per day. Higher doses (60 to 100 mg of elemental iron per day) are sometimes prescribed in populations at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<h4>Dietary Iron</h4>\r\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in pregnant women is 27 mg per day. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes that nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less well-absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in women who eat a purely vegetarian diet.<br><br>Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also important potential sources of iron.&nbsp;Federally regulated iron fortification of U.S. food products began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched grain products has increased over the years.&nbsp;It is estimated that more than 50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has published separate recommendation statements on screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<br>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nStudies that directly evaluate the effects of screening for and early treatment of iron deficiency anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes are needed. Although adequate evidence shows that iron supplementation improves maternal hematologic indexes, the clinical significance of this improvement needs to be defined. Well-designed and adequately powered studies that evaluate the effects of iron supplementation, or change in maternal iron status as a result of intervention, on maternal and infant health outcomes (for example, postpartum hemorrhage, maternal illness, preterm delivery, low birthweight, and perinatal death) are needed, particularly in settings similar to the United States with respect to nutrition, hemoparasite burden, and socioeconomic status.\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nThis recommendation is consistent with the 2006 recommendation statement on iron supplementation during pregnancy. Both the 2006 and the current recommendation statements found insufficient evidence to determine the balance of the benefits and harms of iron supplementation during pregnancy. Although the 2006 statement recommended screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women, the current recommendation found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. In its review of the evidence to update the 2006 recommendation, the USPSTF found no good- or fair-quality studies on the benefits or harms of screening that would be applicable to the current U.S. population of pregnant women. Since 2006, the USPSTF has updated its methodology to better identify evidence that would be most applicable to the current U.S. population. Therefore, the USPSTF determined that the currently available and applicable evidence on screening for and early treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is insufficient.",

It also states that whether iron supplementation in well-nourished pregnant women without anemia affects perinatal outcomes is unclear.&nbsp;Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women to prevent adverse maternal health and birth outcomes.",

      "discussion": "Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which is an essential protein found in erythrocytes. During pregnancy, iron is also needed for the development of the fetus and placenta and to expand maternal erythrocyte mass. Iron deficiency occurs when body stores of iron become depleted. It can develop as a result of an increased need for iron (for example, during pregnancy), decreased iron intake and absorption (for example, lack of iron sources in the diet), or a loss of iron (for example, bleeding). Iron deficiency anemia results when iron stores become so low that hemoglobin synthesis is impaired, which causes anemia.<br><br> Current data on the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in the United States are lacking. Based on older data from a cohort of mostly racial or ethnic minorities, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women ranges from as low as 1.8% during the first trimester to as high as 27.4% during the third trimester.&nbsp;Based on calculations of total body iron from 1999 to 2006 NHANES data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women is 18.6%, which ranges from 6.9% in the first trimester to 29.5% in the third trimester<br>.The major concern about iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is whether it has adverse effects on maternal health or infant outcomes. Older observational studies suggest an association between adverse outcomes in infants and anemia in the early stages of pregnancy but not during the third trimester.&nbsp;Although iron supplementation and treatment during pregnancy have been observed to improve hemoglobin levels and iron status, the clinical significance of this finding is not clear and the evidence on maternal and infant health outcomes is limited.&nbsp;Further, studies evaluating these outcomes are often conducted in countries whose nutritional status and hemoparasite burden vary significantly from those of the United States.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2006 recommendation on screening for iron deficiency anemia. The USPSTF focused on reviewing the evidence on the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention (oral supplementation or treatment) in pregnant women and adolescents and improvement in maternal and infant health outcomes. The use of intravenous iron was not assessed. The USPSTF considered studies conducted in settings similar to the United States in rates of malnutrition, hemoparasite burden, and general socioeconomic status. The focus of the current recommendation is on screening and supplementation for the prevention of iron deficiency anemia; however, findings on iron deficiency are also described as reported by individual studies and to provide a better understanding of the potential burden in the U.S. population.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe primary screening test for anemia is to measure serum hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. However, given the hemodilution and physiologic anemia that normally occurs during pregnancy, using hemoglobin or hematocrit measurement alone to determine iron deficiency status can be imprecise, and its sensitivity and specificity for detecting iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women are unknown. Serum ferritin, which is often used to measure iron status, may have limited use during pregnancy because its concentration often decreases in late pregnancy despite adequate iron stores in the bone marrow. Also, serum ferritin is an acute phase reactant, which means its levels increase during periods of inflammation.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Screening and Treatment</h4>\r\nNo good- or fair-quality studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women or adolescents with regard to maternal or infant health outcomes. In addition, no new studies that would be applicable to the current U.S. population evaluated oral iron treatment of iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women.\r\n<h4>Supplementation</h4>\r\nTwelve good- or fair-quality randomized, controlled trials evaluated the effects of iron supplementation on various maternal hematologic indexes, including hemoglobin level, serum ferritin level, anemia, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia. Eight studies were conducted in the United States or Europe, 3 in Iran, and 1 in Hong Kong; sample sizes ranged from 45 to 1164 participants. Supplement doses ranged from 20 to 120 mg per day, and outcomes were measured at various time points, from the second trimester to the postpartum period.&nbsp;Overall, the evidence was most consistent on improvement in hemoglobin and ferritin levels. Of the 8 studies reporting maternal hemoglobin levels at term or delivery, 6&nbsp;&nbsp;reported a significantly higher mean hemoglobin level in the supplemented versus control groups (122 to 139 g/L vs. 115 to 128 g/L, respectively). Of the 7 studies&nbsp;reporting serum ferritin levels at term or delivery, 5&nbsp;reported a significantly higher ferritin level in the supplemented versus control groups (12.0 to 30.0 &micro;g/L vs. 6.2 to 24.9 &micro;g/L, respectively). Although adequate evidence shows that supplementation increases hemoglobin and ferritin levels, the evidence is unclear on whether this increase leads to an improvement in maternal and fetal health outcomes. In most of these studies, the supplemented groups had higher mean hemoglobin levels than the nonsupplemented groups; however, both groups reported values within normal limits. Evidence on the effects of supplementation on maternal iron deficiency anemia and anemia was inconsistent. <br><br>Five trials&nbsp;evaluated the effects of iron supplementation during pregnancy on maternal health outcomes (for example, cesarean delivery and quality of life), and 11 trials&nbsp;evaluated various infant birth outcomes (for example, preterm delivery, low birthweight, small for gestational age, and infant mortality). Studies were conducted in the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, Ireland, Iran, and Norway; sample sizes ranged from 45 to 1164 participants. Studies used varying doses of iron, ranging from 20 to 200 mg per day. Studies on cesarean delivery and maternal quality of life were sparse or reported inconsistent results. Studies on individual infant birth outcomes were sparse, were frequently underpowered, or reported inconsistent findings overall. Only 4 studies reported on infant mortality&nbsp;and none reported a significant difference with prenatal iron supplementation. However, given the relatively low frequency of this outcome, studies were likely underpowered to detect a change and none reported power calculations for this outcome. Evidence on the effects of supplementation on birthweight was mixed. Of the 8 studies&nbsp;reporting this outcome, 3 found that women receiving iron supplementation during pregnancy gave birth to infants with a significantly higher mean birthweight (95 to 205 g more) than women not receiving iron supplementation; however, both groups reported values within normal limits.&nbsp;Of the 6 studies reporting on low birthweight,&nbsp;only 1&nbsp;found a significantly lower rate of low-birthweight infants; however, these studies may have been underpowered to detect a change. <br><br>Further, of 4 studies&nbsp;reporting on small-for-gestational-age infants, 1 study&nbsp;reported no significant difference in rates between supplemented and nonsupplemented groups, 2 studies&nbsp;reported fewer small-for-gestational-age infants in supplemented groups, and 1 study&nbsp;reported more small-for-gestational-age infants in the supplemented group. Overall, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of supplementation during pregnancy. <br><br>No good- or fair-quality studies that would be applicable to the current U.S. population&nbsp;evaluated the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention (supplementation or treatment) and improvement in maternal or infant health outcomes.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Screening and Treatment</h4>\r\nNo good- or fair-quality studies reported on the harms of screening or early treatment.&nbsp;Potential harms of iron treatment include gastrointestinal symptoms.\r\n<h4>Supplementation</h4>\r\nTen trials&nbsp;reported on the harms of routine iron supplementation during pregnancy. Studies were conducted in the United States, Ireland, Hong Kong, Norway, Iran, and Australia, and sample sizes ranged from 45 to 1164 participants. Supplementation doses ranged from 20 to 200 mg per day. Most reported harms, including nausea, constipation, and diarrhea, were transient and not serious. In general, no significant difference was found between supplemented and control groups. Reported rates of nausea ranged from 29% to 63% in supplemented groups and 28% to 65% in control groups. Reported rates of vomiting ranged from 12% to 41% in supplemented groups and 15% to 41% in control groups. Reported rates of constipation (or &le;3 bowel movements per week) ranged from 4% to 29% in supplemented groups and 1.6% to 28% in control groups. Evidence on supplementation and maternal hypertension was inconsistent, ranging from 1.4% to 7.5% in supplemented groups and 0% to 9% in control groups.&nbsp;Overall, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of supplementation are small to none.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<h4>Screening and Early Detection</h4>\r\nOverall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women and adolescents. No good- or fair-quality studies were found that evaluated the benefits or harms of screening in this population. There was 1 older poor-quality study on the benefits and harms of treatment, but it was not applicable to the current U.S. population of pregnant women. Given the lack of studies on screening, the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia and thus cannot make a recommendation in favor of or against screening.\r\n<h4>Supplementation</h4>\r\nOverall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on the effects of iron supplementation during pregnancy. Although the USPSTF found adequate evidence on harms and deemed them to be small to none, it found inadequate evidence on benefits. Reported benefits of supplementation were limited to intermediate outcomes (maternal hematologic indexes), and evidence on the benefits of supplementation on maternal and infant health outcomes was inadequate because of inconsistent results and underpowered studies. Given the inconsistent findings and lack of adequately powered studies on the effect of supplementation on maternal and infant health outcomes, the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of supplementation and thus cannot make a recommendation in favor of or against iron supplementation.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 31 March to 27 April 2015. A few comments requested more information on which populations are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia and to which population the recommendation applies. Existing language describing risk factors for iron deficiency anemia and the target population for this recommendation was inserted earlier in the statement to make this information clearer. Some comments also requested separate analyses of certain high-risk populations. Although the USPSTF sought this information, limitations in the evidence prevented it from performing separate analyses. A few comments noted ambiguity in how the terms &ldquo;iron deficiency&rdquo; and &ldquo;iron deficiency anemia&rdquo; were used. The recommendation was reviewed to ensure consistent use of each term, and language was added to better explain that the focus of the recommendation is on iron deficiency anemia. The USPSTF also clarified that intravenous iron treatment is a potential therapy that is offered in current practice; however, it was not a focus of the current review.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nBased on older observational data, the association between negative iron status during pregnancy and adverse maternal and infant health outcomes is inconsistent. Some findings indicate that anemia occurring earlier in pregnancy may be associated with serious adverse infant outcomes, but anemia occurring during the third trimester may not. Evidence on the association between improvement in maternal iron status and improvement in maternal and infant health outcomes is lacking. Although treatment and supplementation with oral iron can improve maternal hematologic indexes (most often, hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels), subsequent improvement in maternal and infant outcomes has not been well-demonstrated. This raises questions on whether the timing of identification and correction of iron deficiency anemia plays an important role and whether current measures of iron deficiency anemia (primarily hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin levels) are effective in identifying women who may need additional iron during pregnancy, given the normal occurrence of physiologic anemia and the limitations of interpreting ferritin levels<br><br>\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nThis recommendation is consistent with the 2006 recommendation statement on iron supplementation during pregnancy. Both the 2006 and the current recommendation statements found insufficient evidence to determine the balance of the benefits and harms of iron supplementation during pregnancy. Although the 2006 statement recommended screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women, the current recommendation found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. In its review of the evidence to update the 2006 recommendation, the USPSTF found no good- or fair-quality studies on the benefits or harms of screening that would be applicable to the current U.S. population of pregnant women. Since 2006, the USPSTF has updated its methodology to better identify evidence that would be most applicable to the current U.S. population. Therefore, the USPSTF determined that the currently available and applicable evidence on screening for and early treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is insufficient.",

      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to children ages 6 to 24 months living in the United States who are asymptomatic for iron deficiency anemia. It does not apply to children younger than age 6 months or older than 24 months, children who are severely malnourished, children who were born prematurely or with low birth weight, or children who have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Recommendations regarding screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women and iron supplementation during pregnancy are addressed in a separate recommendation statement (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nEstimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 to 3 years in the United States range from 8% to 14%, and approximately one third of these children also have anemia.&nbsp;Based on 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children ages 12 to 35 months is 2.1%.&nbsp;Several factors have been identified that may increase a child&rsquo;s risk for iron deficiency anemia, including prematurity or low birth weight, use of non&ndash;iron-fortified formula or introduction to cow's milk in the first year of life, and exclusive breastfeeding without regular intake of iron-fortified food after age 6 months. Demographic factors associated with increased risk for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status and having parents who are migrant workers or recent immigrants. Additional factors that may be associated with increased risk for iron deficiency in children include weight and height in the 95th percentile or greater, bottle feeding beyond the first year of life, having a mother who is currently pregnant, or living in an urban area. Evidence on whether Hispanic ethnicity increases children's risk for iron deficiency has been mixed, with some studies showing an increased risk and others showing no increased risk. Older data from NHANES (1988&ndash;1994) showed that Mexican American children were nearly 3 times more likely than white children to have iron deficiency, whereas more recent NHANES data from 1999&ndash;2002 found no increased risk in Hispanic children.&nbsp;The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify children who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia. <br><br>Some observational studies suggest that iron deficiency anemia in early childhood may be associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioral delays and poorer performance on cognitive tests. However, concluding that there is a direct causal link between iron deficiency anemia and these outcomes is difficult because of the methodological flaws in these studies and potential confounding due to underlying nutritional and socioeconomic differences between groups.&nbsp;The aim of screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children is to identify and treat anemia before it leads to poor child health outcomes.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nThe harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. Reported adverse events of treatment with iron include limited gastrointestinal symptoms, darkening color of stool, staining of teeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications. The previous USPSTF recommendation also noted that accidental iron overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with iron.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nNo recent nationally representative data on the current rate of screening are available.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nAlthough the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is often the first step.\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\nIn the United States, iron deficiency anemia in children is usually treated with oral iron. The usual dose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day. In children ages 1 to 3 years, the Recommended Dietary Allowance is 7 mg per day. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes that nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less well absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet.&nbsp;Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods.&nbsp;Iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants. Federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched grain products has increased over the years.&nbsp;More than 50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has published a separate recommendation statement on screening for iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation in pregnant women (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nAlthough iron deficiency anemia has been associated with neurodevelopmental and cognitive impairments and behavioral delays based on observational data, studies that show an improvement in these health outcomes through treatment are lacking. Studies that evaluate the effects (short- and long-term) of change in iron status on health outcomes in settings similar to the United States with respect to nutrition, hemoparasite burden, and socioeconomic status are needed. Similarly, well-designed long-term, controlled studies that evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for and early treatment of asymptomatic iron deficiency anemia on health outcomes (diagnosis of neurodevelopmental, cognitive, or behavioral disease rather than hematologic indexes) are needed.",

Iron deficiency occurs when body stores of iron become depleted. Iron deficiency can occur when there is an increased need for iron (e.g., during rapid growth in infants and toddlers) or when there is decreased iron intake and absorption (e.g., lack of iron sources in the diet). Iron deficiency anemia results when iron stores become so low that hemoglobin synthesis is impaired.<br><br>Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide&nbsp;and in the United States.&nbsp;It represents approximately 40% of cases of anemia in the United States.&nbsp;The estimated overall prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in the United States is 1% to 2% in children ages 1 to 5 years&nbsp;and 2.1% in children ages 12 to 35 months.&nbsp;Depending on the type of study used to estimate rates, the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 to 3 years in the United States ranges from 8% to 14%.<br><br>The major concern about iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children is whether it causes neurodevelopmental or behavioral delays or cognitive impairment. Few well-designed long-term studies on the effects of iron deficiency anemia in infancy and childhood on these health outcomes are available. Based primarily on observational data, studies have found an association between iron deficiency (with or without anemia) in infancy and childhood and impaired neurodevelopment in older children. Cognitive and behavioral delays in children have also been found to be associated with iron deficiency anemia. However, these observational studies have limitations due to the types of measures reported and confounding with nutritional and socioeconomic factors, making causation difficult to determine.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence to update its 2006 recommendation on screening for iron deficiency anemia. The current review assessed the evidence on young children ages 6 to 24 months. The USPSTF focused on reviewing the evidence on the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes, as well as treatment of iron deficiency anemia with oral iron formulations. The USPSTF considered studies conducted in settings similar to the United States in rates of malnutrition, hemoparasite burden, and general socioeconomic status. The focus of the current recommendation is on screening and prevention of iron deficiency anemia; however, findings on iron deficiency, as reported by individual studies, also are provided for a better understanding of the potential burden in the U.S. population.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nSerum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin is sensitive for detecting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency because mild deficiency states may not affect hemoglobin levels.&nbsp;Hemoglobin is also nonspecific, as approximately 60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency.&nbsp;The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%.&nbsp;In infants, particularly before age 12 months, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia often resolve spontaneously, reducing the positive predictive value of any screening test. The sensitivity and specificity of other single tests (e.g., serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin) as primary screening tools for iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied.&nbsp;Serum ferritin, often used to measure iron status, acts as an acute-phase reactant, so it should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24 months and reported on health outcomes. In addition, no new studies of oral iron treatment of iron deficiency anemia in this age group were found. The 2006 evidence review reported on older treatment trials that were not included in this update because they were found to be of poor quality or were conducted in settings not applicable to the current U.S. population. In 2006, the USPSTF concluded that there was poor evidence (conflicting studies) of the effectiveness of interventions that demonstrate improved health outcomes, such as developmental status, in asymptomatic children<br><br>.No studies applicable to the current U.S. population demonstrated an association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes. Indirect evidence from 2 studies of iron supplementation in iron-sufficient children found no difference in growth or developmental scale scores with changes in iron status.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found no new studies that reported on the harms of iron treatment in children ages 6 to 24 months. The 2006 review concluded that there was no evidence on the harms of treatment but noted that accidental iron overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with iron. One older trial from 1991 that was not included in the previous review found no difference in overall or specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal events.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nOverall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24 months. The USPSTF identified no studies that evaluated the benefits or harms of screening in this age group. Studies on the benefits and harms of treatment were generally older, conducted in settings not considered applicable to the current U.S. population, or of poor quality. The USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia and thus cannot make a recommendation in favor of or against screening.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from March 31 to April 27, 2015. A few comments requested more information on which populations are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia and to which population the recommendation applies. Existing language describing risk factors for iron deficiency anemia and the target population for this recommendation was inserted earlier in the statement to make this information clearer. Some comments also requested separate analyses of certain high-risk populations. Although the USPSTF sought this information, limitations in the evidence prevented it from performing separate analyses. A few comments noted that there was ambiguity in how the terms &ldquo;iron deficiency&rdquo; and &ldquo;iron deficiency anemia&rdquo; were used. The recommendation was reviewed to ensure consistent use of each term and language was added to better explain that the focus of the recommendation is on iron deficiency anemia.\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nAlthough associations have been reported between iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and poorer neurodevelopmental measures, such as lower scores on intelligence or cognitive functioning tests, as well as behavioral delays, trials showing that treatment improves these outcomes are lacking. One oft-cited study conducted in Costa Rica reported on long-term developmental outcomes and found that compared with children who had good iron status as infants, children with chronic iron deficiency at ages 12 to 23 months who received treatment and had their anemia resolve within 3 months still scored lower on reading, writing, arithmetic, and motor tests at ages 11 to 14 years, as well as tests of cognitive function at age 19 years.&nbsp;This suggests that preventing iron deficiency anemia may be preferable to treating it once it develops, or that perhaps other nutrients or factors may be mediating the association between iron deficiency anemia and cognitive function and may need to be addressed in addition to iron.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Update of USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nThis recommendation is consistent with the 2006 recommendation statement on screening for iron deficiency anemia in children ages 6 to 12 months; however, this recommendation has been expanded to include children up to age 24 months. Both the 2006 and the current recommendation statement found insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening in young children. While the 2006 recommendation included a statement on supplementation in young children, the USPSTF has now determined that given the current widespread use of iron-fortified foods in the United States, including infant formulas and cereals, the impact of making a recommendation on physician-prescribed supplementation is likely limited. For this reason, the USPSTF decided to focus the current recommendation on screening only.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and nearly one quarter of deaths caused by CVD are considered to be preventable. Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors include abnormal blood glucose, hypertension, hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, smoking, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes typically develops slowly, and progression from normal blood glucose to glucose abnormalities that meet generally accepted criteria for diabetes (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#tab\">Table</a>) may take a decade or longer. Glucose abnormalities that do not meet the criteria for diabetes include impaired fasting glucose (IFG), an impaired response to oral glucose intake (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]), or an increased average blood glucose level as evidenced by increased levels of hemoglobin A1c&nbsp;(HbA1c). Abnormal glucose metabolism is a risk factor for CVD and, in some individuals, may progress to meet the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes. <br><br>According to national data estimates from 2012, approximately 86 million Americans aged 20 years or older have IFG or IGT.Approximately 15% to 30% of these persons will develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years if they do not implement lifestyle changes to improve their health. <br><br>Modifiable risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism (manifested as either diabetes or abnormal glucose levels below the threshold for diabetes) include overweight and obesity or a high percentage of abdominal fat, physical inactivity, and smoking. Abnormal glucose metabolism is also frequently associated with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension.<br><br>Given the increasing prevalence of abnormal glucose metabolism in the U.S. population, the USPSTF sought to examine the benefits and harms of screening for IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence that measuring blood glucose leads to improvements in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity.<br><br>The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that intensive behavioral counseling interventions for persons at increased risk for CVD have moderate benefits in lowering CVD risk. Populations in which these benefits have been shown include persons who are obese or overweight and have hypertension, hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, and/or IFG or IGT. Benefits of behavioral interventions include reductions in blood pressure, glucose and lipid levels, and obesity and an increase in physical activity. Studies that specifically treat persons who have IFG or IGT with intensive lifestyle interventions to prevent the development of diabetes consistently show a moderate benefit in reducing progression to diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have greater effects on reducing progression to diabetes than metformin or other medications.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found that measuring blood glucose is associated with short-term anxiety but not long-term psychological harms. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of lifestyle interventions to reduce the incidence of diabetes are small to none. The harms of drug therapy for the prevention of diabetes are small to moderate, depending on the drug and dosage used.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to measuring blood glucose to detect IFG, IGT, or diabetes and implementing intensive lifestyle interventions for persons found to have abnormal blood glucose. </p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adults aged 40 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who do not have symptoms of diabetes and are overweight or obese. The target population includes persons who are most likely to have glucose abnormalities that are associated with increased CVD risk and can be expected to benefit from primary prevention of CVD through risk factor modification.<br><br>Persons who have a family history of diabetes, have a history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome, or are members of certain racial/ethnic groups (that is, African Americans, American Indians or Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, or Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders) may be at increased risk for diabetes at a younger age or at a lower body mass index. Clinicians should consider screening earlier in persons with 1 or more of these characteristics.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nGlucose abnormalities can be detected by measuring HbA1c&nbsp;or fasting plasma glucose or with an oral glucose tolerance test. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#tab\">Table</a>shows test values for normal glucose metabolism, IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c&nbsp;is a measure of long-term blood glucose concentration and is not affected by acute changes in glucose levels due to stress or illness. Because HbA1c&nbsp;measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test. The oral glucose tolerance test is done in the morning in a fasting state; blood glucose concentration is measured 2 hours after ingestion of a 75-g oral glucose load.<br><br>The diagnosis of IFG, IGT, or type 2 diabetes should be confirmed; repeated testing with the same test on a different day is the preferred method of confirmation.\r\n<h3>Threshold for Behavioral Interventions</h3>\r\nMany studies assessed intensive behavioral interventions for persons at increased CVD risk, but none report a consistent threshold for intervention among persons with abnormal blood glucose. Many studies include persons with multiple risk factors, and CVD risk increases with the number of risk factors and glucose level. Perceived readiness for change and access to appropriate interventions will probably influence treatment recommendations. Although direct evidence that preventing a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes results in improved health outcomes is limited, primary prevention that reduces the chances of a diagnosis may reduce the adverse consequences of disease management. Because the average reduction in glucose levels resulting from intensive behavioral interventions is modest, persons with higher glucose levels may be more likely to benefit and avoid a diabetes diagnosis than those whose glucose levels are closer to normal.\r\n<h3>Type of Intervention</h3>\r\nBehavioral interventions that have an effect on CVD risk and delay or avoid progression of glucose abnormalities to type 2 diabetes combine counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity and are intensive, with multiple contacts over extended periods. The evidence is insufficient to conclude that pharmacologic interventions have the same multifactorial benefits (for example, weight loss or reductions in glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels) as behavioral interventions.\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\nEvidence on the optimal rescreening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is limited.&nbsp;Cohort and modeling studies suggest that rescreening every 3 years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nBecause overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, abnormal lipid levels, high blood pressure, and smoking are all modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular events, the USPSTF recommends screening and appropriate interventions for these conditions (available at<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<br><br>The USPSTF recommends screening for obesity in adults and offering or referring those with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2&nbsp;or greater to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. Although intensive interventions may not be practical in many primary care settings, patients can be referred from primary care to community-based programs for these interventions.<br><br>The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults who are overweight (body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2) and have additional cardiovascular risk factors to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention.<br><br>The USPSTF recommends screening for lipid disorders in men aged 35 years or older and women aged 45 years or older who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease. <br><br>The USPSTF also recommends screening for hypertension in adults aged 18 years or older and that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions to those who use tobacco products.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends combined diet and physical activity promotion programs for persons who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. It found that these programs are effective across a range of counseling intensities, settings, and facilitators. Effective programs commonly include setting a weight loss goal, individual or group sessions about diet and exercise, meetings with a trained diet or exercise counselor, or individually tailored diet or exercise plans. More information is available at<a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/diabetes/combineddietandpa.html\">www.thecommunityguide.org/diabetes/combineddietandpa.html</a>.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found only 2 studies, both conducted in Europe,&nbsp;that directly evaluated the mortality benefit of screening in asymptomatic adults. Neither study had follow-up beyond 10 years or measured nonfatal cardiovascular events. Screening studies that follow larger numbers of participants for 20 years or longer and measure both morbidity and mortality are needed. Further, screening studies in the U.S. population (in which the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is probably higher than that identified in European studies [3%]) are needed. More research is needed on the effects of screening among racial/ethnic minorities because they have a higher prevalence of diabetes than white persons. Clinical trials and additional modeling studies are needed to better elucidate the optimal frequency of screening and the age at which to start screening. More U.S. data are also needed on the benefits and harms of lifestyle interventions and medical treatments for screen-detected IFG, IGT, and diabetes over a longer follow-up period.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nImpaired glucose metabolism initially develops as IFG or IGT and may progress to diabetes. From 2009 to 2012, an estimated 37% of U.S. adults aged 20 years or older had IFG or IGT and 12% had diabetes.&nbsp;After adjustment for population age differences, the percentage of U.S. adults aged 20 years or older with IFG or IGT was similar among white (35%), black (39%), and Hispanic persons (38%). However, diabetes prevalence rates were higher among racial/ethnic minorities than non-Hispanic white persons (7.6%). Among Hispanics, the age-adjusted rate for diagnosed diabetes was 12.8%, with higher rates among Mexican Americans (13.9%) and Puerto Ricans (14.8%). Among Asian Americans, the diabetes prevalence rate was 9.0%, with higher rates among Filipinos (11.3%) and Asian Indians (13.0%). From 2010 to 2012, diabetes prevalence rates were 13.2% for black persons and 15.9% for American Indians and Alaskan Natives.Uncontrolled diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and may also result in other complications, such as vision loss, renal failure, and amputation. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, accounting for more than 44% of new cases of end-stage renal disease in 2011. About 60% of nontraumatic lower-limb amputations occur in persons with diabetes. Among adults of a similar age, the risk for death is 1.5 times higher in those with diabetes than in those without it.\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nTo update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed studies from the prior evidence review and evidence from new trials published since then. The current review focused on screening for IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults who are at average or high risk for diabetes and its complications.&nbsp;The USPSTF examined whether measuring blood glucose to detect diabetes, IFG, or IGT in asymptomatic adults results in improved health outcomes; whether interventions for IFG or IGT prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes; and whether interventions for screen-detected IFG, IGT, or type 2 diabetes provide an incremental benefit in health outcomes compared with no interventions or initiating interventions after clinical diagnosis.The USPSTF also examined the harms of screening and interventions for IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes. The evidence review assessed the benefits and harms of aspirin use and intensive versus standard control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels in persons with diagnosed diabetes. In addition, the USPSTF examined whether the effects of screening and interventions differ by subpopulation (for example, older adults, men vs. women, or racial/ethnic minorities).\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Benefits of Screening</h4>\r\nSince the previous review, 2 new trials conducted in Europe have examined the effects of screening versus no screening. ADDITION-Cambridge (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment In People With Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care)&nbsp;was a good-quality, cluster randomized, controlled trial with 19,226 participants, screening at 27 sites, and no screening at 5 sites. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality at 10-year follow-up was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.25). No differences were found between the screened and nonscreened groups in cardiovascular-, cancer-, or diabetes-related mortality or death from other causes. Limitations of this study include lack of longer-term (&gt;10 years) follow-up and lack of data on other macrovascular and microvascular outcomes, such as nonfatal cardiovascular events. A second study,&nbsp;conducted at a single site in the United Kingdom (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 4936), resulted in a moderate significant reduction in all-cause mortality (HR, 0.79 [CI, 0.63 to 1.00]). Data on other health outcomes were limited. The USPSTF considered this study to be of fair to poor quality because of unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods and important baseline difference between the screened and nonscreened groups.Given the limitations of these 2 studies, the USPSTF determined that the evidence is inadequate to determine the direct benefits and harms of screening versus no screening.\r\n<h4>Interventions to Prevent or Delay Progression to Type 2 Diabetes</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF identified 10 studies (6 new and 4 included in the previous review) that focused on lifestyle interventions to prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;A meta-analysis of these 10 trials showed a relative risk (RR) of 0.53 (CI, 0.39 to 0.72;&nbsp;<em>I</em>2&nbsp;= 88%). The USPSTF determined that there is adequate evidence that lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes.The USPSTF identified 8 studies published since the prior review that assessed the effects of pharmacologic interventions to prevent or delay progression to diabetes.&nbsp;Metformin, thiazolidinediones, and &alpha;-glucosidase inhibitors were all found to be effective in preventing or delaying progression to type 2 diabetes.\r\n<h4>Effects of Screening Versus Not Screening and Initiating Interventions After Clinical Diagnosis</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF found no trials that evaluated the incremental benefit on health outcomes of initiating interventions after clinical diagnosis compared with at the time of screening. The USPSTF identified 3 trials that suggested benefit of lifestyle interventions in patients with IFG or IGT. The Diabetes Prevention Program,&nbsp;conducted in the United States in 3234 participants, found that an intensive lifestyle modification intervention was associated with better quality of life at 3-year follow-up. One Finnish&nbsp;and 1 Chinese&nbsp;trial, each with more than 500 participants, suggested improvements in all-cause mortality outcomes after 10 and 20 years, respectively (HR, 0.57 [CI, 0.21 to 1.58] and 0.96 [CI, 0.65 to 1.14], respectively), but these trials were underpowered to evaluate these outcomes. However, by 23-year follow-up, the Chinese trial found decreased risk for cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.59 [CI, 0.36 to 0.96]) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.71 [CI, 0.51 to 0.99]) in the intervention group compared with the control group.&nbsp;These findings were primarily due to significant differences in mortality outcomes between women in the intervention and control groups (all-cause mortality HR, 0.46 [CI, 0.24 to 0.87]; cardiovascular mortality HR, 0.28 [CI, 0.11 to 0.71]). The lifestyle intervention had no significant effect on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in men (all-cause mortality HR, 0.97 [CI, 0.65 to 1.46]; cardiovascular mortality HR, 0.91 [CI, 0.50 to 1.65]). Post hoc analyses suggested that the reduced mortality associated with the intervention was mediated by its effect on delaying the onset of diabetes. Pharmacologic interventions for screen-detected IFG, IGT, or diabetes showed no reduction in cardiovascular mortality based on a meta-analysis of 5 trials, with a mean follow-up of 3 to 6 years (risk ratio, 1.07 [CI, 0.84 to 1.35];&nbsp;<em>I2</em>&nbsp;= 0%).\r\n<h4>Benefits of Intensive Versus Standard Control of Blood Glucose Levels, Blood Pressure, and Lipid Levels</h4>\r\nAmong patients with diagnosed diabetes (that is, not screen-detected), intensive glycemic control was not associated with reduced risk for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality compared with standard glycemic control.&nbsp;Intensive glycemic control was associated with reduced risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction and microvascular disease but increased risk for severe hypoglycemia. To assess whether intensive blood pressure control was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity compared with standard control, the USPSTF examined the results of 5 trials&mdash;ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes), ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation), HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment), and the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study).These trials had heterogeneous populations, medications, and blood pressure goals. No clear benefit was found in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality with intensive blood pressure control. However, a consistent benefit of stroke reduction was found in study groups with intensive versus standard blood pressure control.&nbsp;For example, in the ACCORD trial, the target systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg was associated with an RR of 0.58 (CI, 0.39 to 0.88) for stroke incidence compared with standard blood pressure control (target systolic blood pressure of &lt;140 mm Hg). The USPSTF found no studies on the effects of intensive versus standard lipid control in persons with screen-detected diabetes. The ACCORD study&nbsp;found that intensive lipid-lowering therapy was associated with reduced risk for a composite cardiovascular outcome in men with diabetes but possible harm in women (interaction&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;= 0.01).Lipid-lowering therapy seemed to be similarly effective in RR reduction regardless of diabetes status. A Japanese study&nbsp;that randomly assigned approximately 8000 participants to pravastatin versus placebo found similar estimates of risk for all-cause mortality, stroke, and cardiovascular events in participants with diabetes, IFG or IGT, or normal blood glucose levels. A meta-analysis of 14 trials of statinsfound similar risks for vascular events in both persons with diabetes (RR, 0.79 [CI, 0.72 to 0.87]) and without diabetes (RR, 0.79 [CI, 0.76 to 0.82]).\r\n<h4>Benefits of Multifactorial Interventions</h4>\r\nThe ADDITION-Europe trial&nbsp;evaluated the effects of intensive versus standard control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels in a population with screen-detected diabetes (mean HbA1c&nbsp;level was 6.5% for both groups at baseline). No significant differences were found between study groups in risk for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.83 [CI, 0.65 to 1.05]) or cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.88 [CI, 0.51 to 1.51]). In addition, no significant differences were found in risk for stroke (HR, 0.98 [CI, 0.57 to 1.71]), myocardial infarction (HR, 0.70 [CI, 0.41 to 1.21]), or revascularization (HR, 0.79 [CI, 0.52 to 1.18]) after 5-year follow-up.The USPSTF identified 4 trials of multifactorial interventions in persons with existing diabetes. Baseline HbA1c&nbsp;levels (range, 7.4% to 8.8%) were higher among these trial participants than in the ADDITION-Europe trial. The ADVANCE trial found reduced risk for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.70 to 0.99]) and cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.76 [CI, 0.60 to 0.98]) at 4-year follow-up.&nbsp;Similarly, the Steno-2 Study&nbsp;showed a reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.40 to 0.90]) and cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.47 [CI, 0.23 to 0.98]) after 13-year follow-up.&nbsp;However, SANDS (Stop Atherosclerosis in Native Diabetics),&nbsp;conducted in American Indians, and JEDIT (Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial)&nbsp;in Japan showed no difference between intensive and standard therapy after 3- and 6-year follow-up, respectively.\r\n<h4>Benefits of Aspirin Use</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF identified 2 systematic reviews,&nbsp;that found no significant differences in RR reduction between aspirin use and nonuse in persons with diabetes.\r\n<h4>Differential Effects of Screening or Interventions by Subpopulation</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated whether the effects of screening vary by subpopulation, such as by age, sex, or race/ethnicity.\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Interventions</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of screening for IFG, IGT, or diabetes. One study&nbsp;found that invitation to screening and a new diagnosis of diabetes were associated with short-term anxiety, but 2 longer-term studies&nbsp;found no negative psychological effects associated with screening or a new diagnosis. The diagnosis of IFG or IGT may potentially create harm through labeling. No studies to date have shown this effect, however, and it is unclear whether the harms of labeling a person at risk would be counteracted by the potential benefits of reducing that person&rsquo;s chances of developing diabetes.Two studies compared lifestyle interventions with usual care and reported no difference in all-cause withdrawal rates&nbsp;or adverse events.The Diabetes Prevention Program&nbsp;reported no differences in serious or nonserious events between the metformin and placebo groups. One trial found that acarbose was associated with higher risk for withdrawal because of adverse events compared with placebo.&nbsp;One large trial found that nateglinide&nbsp;was associated with increased risk for hypoglycemia compared with placebo (RR, 1.73 [CI, 1.57 to 1.92]); further, valsartan was associated&nbsp;with hypotension-related adverse events (RR, 1.16 [CI, 1.11 to 1.23]). One trial&nbsp;found that rosiglitazone was associated with increased risk for congestive heart failure (HR, 7.04 [CI, 1.6 to 31]), but the estimate was imprecise.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF assessed the overall benefit of screening for IFG, IGT, and diabetes to be moderate. The effects of lifestyle interventions to prevent or delay progression to diabetes were consistent across a substantive body of literature. Limited data from longer-term studies suggest that these interventions may also be associated with improved health outcomes. The potential harms of measuring blood glucose and initiating lifestyle modifications that include healthy eating behaviors and increased physical activity are small to none, which leads the USPSTF to conclude with moderate certainty that these interventions have a moderate net benefit.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 7 October 2014 to 5 November 2014. The USPSTF reviewed all public comments received. In response, the USPSTF revised the final recommendation to clarify the populations considered to be at increased risk and provided more details about lifestyle interventions found to be most effective for prevention. The USPSTF also reexamined the potential harms of labeling associated with screening and found limited harms.\r\n<h3>Update of the Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\n<br>This is an update of the 2008 USPSTF recommendation statement in which the USPSTF recommended screening for diabetes in asymptomatic adults with hypertension (defined as sustained blood pressure of &gt;135/80 mm Hg) (B recommendation). At that time, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening in adults without hypertension (blood pressure of &le;135/80 mm Hg) (I statement). Since the previous recommendation, 6 new lifestyle intervention studies have shown consistent benefit of lifestyle modifications to prevent or delay progression to diabetes and longer-term follow-up has increased confidence that such interventions can improve clinical outcomes. This new body of evidence led the USPSTF to conclude that there is moderate net benefit to measuring blood glucose in adults who are at increased risk for diabetes.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. In 2015, an estimated 232,000 women were diagnosed with the disease and 40,000 women died of it. It is most frequently diagnosed among women aged 55 to 64 years, and the median age of death from breast cancer is 68 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><br></a></p>\r\n<h3>Benefit and Harms of Screening and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality in women aged 40 to 74 years. The number of breast cancer deaths averted increases with age; women aged 40 to 49 years benefit the least and women aged 60 to 69 years benefit the most. Age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer, and the increased benefit observed with age is at least partly due to the increase in risk. Women aged 40 to 49 years who have a first-degree relative with breast cancer have a risk for breast cancer similar to that of women aged 50 to 59 years without a family history. Direct evidence about the benefits of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older is lacking.<br><br>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for breast cancer with mammography results in harms for women aged 40 to 74 years. The most important harm is the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to a woman&rsquo;s health, or even apparent, during her lifetime (that is, overdiagnosis and overtreatment). False-positive results are common and lead to unnecessary and sometimes invasive follow-up testing, with the potential for psychological harms (such as anxiety). False-negative results (that is, missed cancer) also occur and may provide false reassurance. Radiation-induced breast cancer and resulting death can also occur, although the number of both of these events is predicted to be low.<br><br>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method for breast cancer. Similarly, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram. In both cases, while there is some information about the accuracy of these methods, there is no information on the effects of their use on health outcomes, such as breast cancer incidence, mortality, or overdiagnosis rates.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening mammography in women aged 50 to 74 years is moderate.</li>\r\n<li>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening mammography in the general population of women aged 40 to 49 years, while positive, is small.</li>\r\n<li>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on mammography screening in women age 75 years and older is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</li>\r\n<li>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on DBT as a primary screening modality for breast cancer is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</li>\r\n<li>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasound, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</li>\r\n</ul>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Benefit of Screening</h3>\r\nThe results of the meta-analysis of clinical trials from the systematic evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF are summarized in<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab1\">Table 1</a>. Over a 10-year period, screening 10,000 women aged 60 to 69 years will result in 21 (95% CI, 11 to 32) fewer breast cancer deaths. The benefit is smaller in younger women: screening 10,000 women aged 50 to 59 years will result in 8 (CI, 2 to 17) fewer breast cancer deaths, and screening 10,000 women aged 40 to 49 years will result in 3 (CI, 0 to 9) fewer breast cancer deaths.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;Most of these trials began enrollment more than 30 years ago, and these estimates may not reflect the current likelihood of avoiding a breast cancer death with contemporary screening mammography technology. Mammography imaging has since improved, which may result in more tumors being detected at a curable stage today than at the time of these trials. However, breast cancer treatments have also improved, and as treatment improves, the advantage of earlier detection decreases, so that some of the women who died of breast cancer in the nonscreened groups in these trials would survive today.\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>\r\nThe most important harm of screening is the detection and treatment of invasive and noninvasive cancer that would never have been detected, or threaten health, in the absence of screening (overdiagnosis and overtreatment). Existing science does not allow for the ability to determine precisely what proportion of cancer diagnosed by mammography today reflects overdiagnosis, and estimates vary widely depending on the data source and method of calculation used.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;In the United States, the rate of diagnosis of invasive plus noninvasive breast cancer increased by 50% during the era of mammography screening (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#fig\">Figure</a>).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation5\">5</a>&nbsp;It is not possible to know with certainty what proportion of that increase is due to overdiagnosis and what proportion reflects other reasons for a rising incidence. If overdiagnosis is the only explanation for the increase, 1 in 3 women diagnosed with breast cancer today is being treated for cancer that would never have been discovered or caused her health problems in the absence of screening. The best estimates from randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of mammography screening on breast cancer mortality suggest that 1 in 5 women diagnosed with breast cancer over approximately 10 years will be overdiagnosed.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;Modeling studies conducted in support of this recommendation by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) provide a range of estimates that reflect different underlying assumptions; the median estimate is that 1 in 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer with biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years will be overdiagnosed. The rate increases with an earlier start age or with annual mammography.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;Even with the conservative estimate of 1 in 8 breast cancer cases being overdiagnosed, for every woman who avoids a death from breast cancer through screening, 2 to 3 women will be treated unnecessarily. <br><br>The other principal harms of screening are false-positive results, which require further imaging and often breast biopsy, and false-negative results.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2\">Table 2</a>&nbsp;summarizes the rates of these harms per screening round using registry data for digital mammography from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), a collaborative network of 5 mammography registries and 2 affiliated sites with linkages to tumor registries across the United States.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;(Note that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2\">Table 2</a>&nbsp;describes a different time horizon than&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab1\">Table 1</a>&nbsp;[per screening round rather than per decade]).\r\n<h3>When to Start Screening</h3>\r\nClinical trials, observational studies, and modeling studies all demonstrate that the likelihood of avoiding a breast cancer death with regular screening mammography increases with age, and this increase in benefit likely occurs gradually rather than abruptly at any particular age. In contrast, the harms of screening mammography either remain constant or decrease with age. For example, about the same number of breast biopsies are performed as a result of screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years as in those aged 60 to 69 years, but many more of these biopsies will result in a diagnosis of invasive cancer in the older age group. Thus, the balance of benefit and harms improves with age (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3\">Table 3</a>). <br><br>The USPSTF concludes that while there are harms of mammography, the benefit of screening mammography outweighs the harms by at least a moderate amount from age 50 to 74 years and is greatest for women in their 60s. For women in their 40s, the number who benefit from starting regular screening mammography is smaller and the number experiencing harm is larger compared with older women. For women in their 40s, the benefit still outweighs the harms, but to a smaller degree; this balance may therefore be more subject to individual values and preferences than it is in older women. Women in their 40s must weigh a very important but infrequent benefit (reduction in breast cancer deaths) against a group of meaningful and more common harms (overdiagnosis and overtreatment, unnecessary and sometimes invasive follow-up testing and psychological harms associated with false-positive test results, and false reassurance from false-negative test results). Women who value the possible benefit of screening mammography more than they value avoiding its harms can make an informed decision to begin screening. <br><br>Neither clinical trials nor models can precisely predict the potential benefits and harms that an individual woman can expect from beginning screening at age 40 rather than 50 years, as these data represent population effects. However, model results may be the easiest way for women to visualize the relative tradeoffs of beginning screening at age 40 versus 50 years. CISNET conducted modeling studies to predict the lifetime benefits and harms of screening with contemporary digital mammography at different starting and stopping ages and screening intervals. The models varied their assumptions about the natural history of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer and the effect of detection by digital mammography on survival. The models assumed the ideal circumstances of perfect adherence to screening and current best practices for therapy across the life span.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3\">Table 3</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>compares the median and range across the models for predicted lifetime benefits and harms of screening biennially from ages 50 to 74 years with screening biennially from ages 40 to 74 years. (Note that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3\">Table 3</a>&nbsp;differs from Tables&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab1\">1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2\">2</a>&nbsp;in terms of population metrics [per 1000 vs. 10,000 women] and time horizon considered [lifetime vs. 10-year or single event]). <br><br>It is, however, a false dichotomy to assume that the only options are to begin screening at age 40 or to wait until age 50 years. As women advance through their 40s, the incidence of breast cancer rises. The balance of benefit and harms may also shift accordingly over this decade, such that women in the latter half of the decade likely have a more favorable balance than women in the first half. Indeed, the CISNET models suggest that most of the benefit of screening women aged 40 to 49 years would be realized by starting screening at age 45.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>\r\n<h3>Risk Factors That May Influence When to Start Screening</h3>\r\nAdvancing age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer in most women, but epidemiologic data from the BCSC suggest that having a first-degree relative with breast cancer is associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;Further, the CISNET models suggest that for women with about a 2-fold increased risk for breast cancer, starting annual digital screening at age 40 years results in a similar harm-to-benefit ratio (based on number of false-positive results or overdiagnosed cases per 1000 breast cancer deaths avoided) as beginning biennial digital screening at age 50 years in average-risk women.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;This approach has not been formally tested in a clinical trial; therefore, there is no direct evidence that it would result in net benefit similar to that of women aged 50 to 74 years. However, given the increased burden of disease and potential likelihood of benefit, women aged 40 to 49 years who have a known first-degree relative (parent, child, or sibling) with breast cancer may consider initiating screening earlier than age 50 years. Many other risk factors have been associated with breast cancer in epidemiologic studies, but most of these relationships are weak or inconsistent and would not likely influence how women value the tradeoffs of the potential benefits and harms of screening. Risk calculators, such as the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (available at<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/BCRISKTOOL\">www.cancer.gov/BCRISKTOOL</a><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer\">This link goes offsite. Click to read the external link disclaimer</a>), have good calibration between predicted and actual outcomes in groups of women but are not accurate at predicting an individual woman&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation10\">10</a>\r\n<h3>How Often to Screen</h3>\r\nOnce a woman has decided to begin screening, the next decision is how often to undergo screening. No clinical trials compared annual mammography with a longer interval in women of any age. In the randomized trials that demonstrated the effectiveness of mammography in reducing breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 74 years, screening intervals ranged from 12 to 33 months.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;There was no clear trend for greater benefit in trials of annual mammography, but other differences between the trials preclude certainty that no difference in benefit exists. Available observational evidence evaluating the effects of varying mammography intervals found no difference in the number of breast cancer deaths between women aged 50 years or older who were screened biennially versus annually.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3\">3</a> <br><br>Regardless of the starting age for screening, the models consistently predict a small incremental increase in the number of breast cancer deaths averted when moving from biennial to annual mammography, but also a large increase in the number of harms (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab4\">Table 4</a>).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF concludes that for most women, biennial mammography screening provides the best overall balance of benefit and harms.\r\n<h3>When to Consider Stopping Screening</h3>\r\nClinical trial data for women aged 70 to 74 years are inconclusive. In its 2009 recommendation,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation11\">11</a>&nbsp;the USPSTF extended the recommendation for screening mammography to age 74 years based on the extrapolation that much of the benefit seen in women aged 60 to 69 years should continue in this age range, and modeling done at the time supported this assumption. Current CISNET models suggest that women aged 70 to 74 years with moderate to severe comorbid conditions that negatively affect their life expectancy are unlikely to benefit from mammography.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation12\">12</a>&nbsp;Moderate comorbid conditions include cardiovascular disease, paralysis, and diabetes. Severe comorbid conditions include (but are not limited to) AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, chronic renal failure, dementia, congestive heart failure, and combinations of moderate comorbid conditions, as well as myocardial infarction, ulcer, and rheumatologic disease.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation12\">12</a>\r\n<h3>Screening in Women Aged 75 Years or Older</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older. CISNET models suggest that biennial mammography screening may potentially continue to offer a net benefit after age 74 years among women with no or low comorbidity,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;but no randomized trials of screening included women in this age group.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3\">3</a>\r\n<h3>DBT as a Primary Screening Strategy</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method for breast cancer.\r\n<h4>Background</h4>\r\nEvidence on DBT is limited; a single study on the test characteristics of DBT as a primary screening strategy for breast cancer met the inclusion criteria of the systematic evidence review.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>\r\nFrom the limited data available, DBT seems to reduce recall rates (that is, follow-up for additional imaging or testing) and increase cancer detection rates compared with conventional digital mammography alone.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;However, current study designs cannot determine whether all of the additional cases of cancer detected would have become clinically significant (that is, the degree of overdiagnosis) or whether there is an incremental clinical benefit to detecting these cancers earlier than with conventional digital mammography. In addition, no studies of DBT looked at clinical outcomes, such as breast cancer morbidity or mortality or quality of life.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nAs currently practiced in most settings, DBT exposes women to approximately twice the amount of radiation as conventional digital mammography.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a method to generate synthetic reconstruction of 2-dimensional images from 3-dimensional views, which reduces the total radiation dose associated with DBT. Although the extent to which this new software technology has been implemented in mammography screening centers is not precisely known, it is currently thought to be low. In women with abnormal findings, DBT may also increase the rate of breast biopsy compared with conventional digital mammography.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>\r\n<h3>Primary and Adjunctive Screening in Women With Dense Breasts</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.\r\n<h4>Epidemiology of Dense Breasts</h4>\r\nIn the United States, the most commonly used classification system for breast density is the American College of Radiology&rsquo;s Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4-category scale (a = the breasts are almost entirely fatty; b = there are scattered areas of fibroglandular density; c = the breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses; or d = the breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography). Data from the BCSC indicate that about 25 million women (about 43%) aged 40 to 74 years are classified as having heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts. The proportion of women with dense breasts is highest among those aged 40 to 49 years and decreases with age.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation14\">14</a> <br><br>Increased breast density is a risk factor for breast cancer. Data from the BCSC indicate that, compared with women with average breast density, women aged 40 to 49 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts have a relative risk (RR) of 1.23 for developing invasive breast cancer. For women aged 50 to 64 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts, the RR is 1.29, and for women aged 65 to 74 years, it is 1.30.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;However, women with dense breasts who develop breast cancer do not have an increased risk for dying from the disease, after adjustment for stage, treatment, method of detection, and other risk factors, according to data from the BCSC.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation15\">15</a>\r\n<h4>Primary Screening Test Performance Characteristics</h4>\r\nIncreased breast density reduces the sensitivity and specificity of mammography for detecting cancer. A BCSC study of more than 300,000 women found that sensitivity decreased from 87% in the lowest density category to 63% in the highest, and specificity decreased from 96% to 90% as breast density increased.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation16\">16</a> <br><br>A woman&rsquo;s BI-RADS breast density classification can be inconstant over time. Good-quality studies of U.S. radiologists demonstrate that major recategorization of sequential screening examinations (that is, from &ldquo;dense&rdquo; [c/d] to &ldquo;nondense&rdquo; [a/b] or vice versa) occurs in approximately 13% to 19% of women.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;These studies excluded women taking hormone medications or those with other medical conditions that may have resulted in physiologic changes that would explain the difference in breast density classification observed between examinations. Reclassification of breast density status from year to year complicates women&rsquo;s assessment of their underlying breast cancer risk, as well as informed screening and care decisions.\r\n<h4>Primary Screening Frequency</h4>\r\nIn 1 BCSC study, biennial screening mammography was associated with greater risk for advanced-stage cancer (stage IIB or greater) (odds ratio, 2.39 [CI, 1.06 to 3.39]) or a breast tumor larger than 20 mm (odds ratio, 2.39 [CI, 1.37 to 3.18]) in women aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts (BI-RADS category d) compared with annual screening; this risk was not seen in women aged 50 to 74 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation19\">19</a>&nbsp;No significant differences in lymph node involvement were observed in either age group. Information about morbidity or mortality end points is not available, so whether these women ultimately fared any differently in their clinical outcomes is not known.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation19\">19</a> <br><br>All women aged 40 to 74 years with increased breast density are at increased risk for a false-positive result, an unnecessary breast biopsy, or a false-negative result compared with women with average breast density. Screening more frequently (that is, annually vs. biennially) further increases the probability that a woman will experience one of these screening-related harms. Data from the BCSC indicate that the cumulative probability that a woman aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts screened annually for a decade will receive a false-positive result is about 69%, compared with about 21% for biennial screening. Similarly, unnecessary breast biopsy rates are 12% for annual screening versus 3% for biennial screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a>\r\n<h4>Adjunctive Screening</h4>\r\n<strong>Potential benefits.</strong>&nbsp;Current evidence on adjunctive screening is very limited, but it suggests that for women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative mammogram, ultrasonography or MRI will detect additional breast cancer but will also result in a higher number of false-positive results. Data on DBT in women with dense breasts are limited, but in the short term, DBT also detects additional breast cancer. Most of the additional cancer detected by these methods are invasive tumors rather than ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;A short-term increase in the number of cancer cases detected does not allow for the conclusion that adjunctive screening reduces treatment-related morbidity or breast cancer deaths or improves women&rsquo;s quality of life. Although adjunctive screening may detect more breast cancer, these cancers may fall into 1 of 3 categories: 1) those for which earlier detection leads to improved outcomes, 2) those that would have had the same outcome when detected later, or 3) those that are overdiagnosed and would not have caused a health problem during a woman&rsquo;s lifetime and may result in harms from unnecessary treatment. Existing data do not allow for estimation of the proportion of cancer that falls into each category; therefore, the benefits on health cannot be estimated. <br><br><strong>Potential harms.</strong>&nbsp;Most positive adjunctive breast cancer screening test results are false positive. Compared with mammography alone, adjunctive screening with ultrasonography or MRI seems to increase recall and biopsy rates. Data on the effects of DBT on recall and biopsy rates in women with dense breasts are too limited to draw conclusions.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;The effects of DBT on overdiagnosis rates are unknown. <br><br><strong>Current practice.</strong>&nbsp;At the present time, 24 states require patient notification of breast density status when mammography is performed; in some states, legislation also includes language to be sent to women informing them that they should consider adjunctive screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>No clinical practice guidelines explicitly recommend adjunctive screening in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>\r\n<h4>Assessment</h4>\r\nIncreased breast density is very common. It is an independent risk factor for developing (but not dying of) breast cancer, and it reduces mammography&rsquo;s ability to find and accurately identify breast cancer. Many women will move between &ldquo;dense&rdquo; and &ldquo;nondense&rdquo; breast classifications with sequential screening mammograms, and these reclassifications are not primarily due to physiologic causes. More evidence is needed to better understand how the frequency of screening might affect important health outcomes in women with dense breasts. Overall, many important questions remain about the potential role of breast density in individualizing screening approaches, and the current evidence is insufficient to recommend a specific screening strategy for women with increased breast density.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has made recommendations about the use of medications to reduce women&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer, as well as risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for&nbsp;<em>BRCA1-</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>-related cancer (including breast cancer). These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",

      "other": "<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nTrial data are too limited to directly inform the question of what the best screening strategy is for women or how clinicians can best tailor that strategy to the individual. Overdiagnosis and resulting overtreatment of breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to a woman&rsquo;s health during her lifetime is the most important harm associated with breast cancer screening. Because it is impossible to determine for any individual patient whether a diagnosed cancer will or will not progress, measurements of overdiagnosis are not straightforward but rather are indirectly quantified. Current estimates of the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with mammography screening vary widely. Researchers in the field must work together to critically evaluate and ultimately agree on uniform definitions and standards to optimally measure and monitor overdiagnosis and overtreatment in breast cancer screening programs. In addition, research is critically needed to identify ways to reduce the occurrence of overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment associated with breast cancer screening. Ductal carcinoma in situ is an example of a breast lesion with the potential for high rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Before the widespread use of screening mammography, 6 cases of DCIS per 100,000 U.S. women per year were identified compared with 37 cases of DCIS per 100,000 women per year after its introduction.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation5\">5</a>&nbsp;When classified as cancer, DCIS now accounts for about 1 in 4 of all breast cancer diagnosed in a given year.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation20\">20</a>&nbsp;However, its nomenclature has recently been the subject of debate, because by definition, DCIS is confined to the mammary ductal&ndash;lobular system and is incapable of metastasis (that is, it is noninvasive and thus lacks the classic characteristic of cancer).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation21\">21</a>&nbsp;Ductal carcinoma in situ may therefore be more appropriately classified as a risk factor for future development of cancer; the primary goal in its management is to reduce the incidence of new invasive carcinoma. The natural history of DCIS&mdash;particularly screen-detected DCIS&mdash;is poorly understood. Although a substantial proportion of these lesions will not progress to invasive cancer,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation22\">22</a>&nbsp;which women will and which will not develop such cancer cannot be predicted with certainty. As such, nearly all women diagnosed with DCIS receive treatment (generally either mastectomy or lumpectomy with or without radiation; a chemopreventive agent, such as tamoxifen, may also be offered).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation23\">23</a>&nbsp;The 20-year breast cancer mortality rate after treatment of DCIS is as low as 3%;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation24\">24</a>&nbsp;whether this is due to the effectiveness of the interventions or the fact that most DCIS cases being treated are essentially benign is a pressing research question. Research is needed to develop better prognostic indicators to distinguish nonprogressive or slowly progressive lesions from tumors that are likely to affect quality or length of life. Research is also needed to compare the long-term benefits and harms of immediate treatment versus observation or surveillance with delayed intervention in women with screen-detected DCIS. Most of the available screening trials and high-quality cohort studies were performed in Europe and predominately enrolled white women younger than age 70 years. Direct evidence about any differential effectiveness of breast cancer screening is lacking for important subgroups of women, such as African American women, who are at increased risk for dying of breast cancer, and older women, for whom balancing the potential benefits and harms of screening may become increasingly challenging with advancing age. Newer technologies, such as DBT for primary screening or ultrasonography and MRI for adjunctive screening in women with dense breasts, are being increasingly used in the United States without clear evidence to demonstrate their effectiveness in improving important health outcomes. Such studies are necessary prerequisites for the appropriate incorporation of these methods into established screening programs.Finally, a large proportion of women in the United States are classified as having dense breasts after screening mammography. Increased breast density is common in the general population; however, critical questions remain about how best to manage this condition and to support these women. Research to help improve the validity and reproducibility of serial BI-RADS assessments would be useful if breast density is to be considered as a factor for personalized, risk-based approaches to breast cancer screening. In addition, long-term randomized trials or longitudinal cohort studies are needed that compare screening outcomes in women with dense breasts who are not otherwise at increased risk for breast cancer who receive adjunctive screening versus those who do not and report important outcomes, such as breast cancer stage at diagnosis, breast cancer recurrence rates, rates of overdiagnosis, and most importantly, breast cancer mortality.",
      "discussion": "<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF commissioned a series of systematic evidence reviews in support of this recommendation. The first addressed the effectiveness of breast cancer screening in reducing breast cancer&ndash;specific and all-cause mortality, as well as the incidence of advanced breast cancer and treatment-related morbidity. It also looked at the harms of breast cancer screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2-4</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;A second systematic review summarized the evidence about the test performance characteristics of DBT as a primary screening strategy.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;A third systematic review evaluated the evidence on adjunctive screening in women with increased breast density, including the accuracy and reproducibility of dense breast classification systems and the diagnostic test performance characteristics, benefits, and harms of adjunctive screening in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a> <br><br>In addition to the systematic reviews of the evidence, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the CISNET Breast Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative decision models on optimal starting and stopping ages and intervals for screening mammography, as well as how breast density, breast cancer risk, and comorbidity level affect the balance of benefit and harms of screening mammography.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;A second decision analysis estimated the number of radiation-induced breast cancer cases and deaths associated with different screening mammography strategies over the course of a woman&rsquo;s lifetime.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation25\">25</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation26\">26</a>\r\n<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nThere are approximately 125 new cases of breast cancer and about 22 deaths per 100,000 U.S. women each year. The mean age at diagnosis has remained unchanged at 64 years since the late 1970s.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation27\">27</a>&nbsp;The median age at death is 68 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation1\">1</a>\r\n<h3>Risk Factors: Additional Considerations</h3>\r\nAbout 5% to 10% of women who develop breast cancer have a mother or sister who also has breast cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a><br><br> A few clinically significant factors are associated with high risk (RR, &ge;4) for breast cancer (women with a&nbsp;<em>BRCA1</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>&nbsp;gene mutation or other hereditary genetic syndromes or women with a history of high-dose radiation therapy to the chest at a young age, such as for treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Women with these risk factors are not within the scope of this recommendation. <br><br>Race and ethnicity is a factor that has prompted concern because of a growing disparity in breast cancer mortality rates. Although white women have historically had higher incidence rates than African American women, incidence rates have come close to converging as of 2012 (128 vs. 124 cases per 100,000 women per year, respectively).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation28\">28</a>&nbsp;More African American women die each year from breast cancer than white women (about 31 vs. 22 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 women per year, respectively).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation5\">5</a>&nbsp;The reason for the difference in breast cancer mortality between white and African American women is not clear. It may be in part due to differences in biology&mdash;African American women are disproportionally affected by more aggressive and treatment-resistant forms of breast cancer (that is, cancer with adverse histologic features, such as poorly differentiated tumors and triple-negative phenotypes).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation29\">29</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation30\">30</a>Unfortunately, these types of cancer may be the least likely to be positively affected by screening programs, because they can grow so rapidly that they develop and spread entirely within the timespan between screening examinations. The difference in mortality rate may also be due to socioeconomic differences and health system failures. Multiple studies have shown an association between African American race and experiencing delays in receiving health care services for cancer, not receiving appropriate treatment, or not receiving treatment at all.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation31\">31-33</a>&nbsp;African American women are also substantially underrepresented in RCTs of mammography screening. As such, there is no high-quality evidence to conclude that screening African American women more often or earlier than already recommended for the overall population of women would result in fewer breast cancer deaths or a greater net benefit.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nAll available RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of breast cancer screening used film mammography. Despite a lack of direct evidence of effectiveness in reducing breast cancer deaths, conventional digital mammography has essentially replaced film mammography as the primary method for breast cancer screening in the United States. Conventional digital screening mammography has been shown to have about the same diagnostic accuracy as film, although digital screening seems to have comparatively higher sensitivity in women younger than age 50 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation34\">34</a>&nbsp;Across all ages, screening mammography has a sensitivity of approximately 77% to 95% and a specificity of about 94% to 97%.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation35\">35</a> <br><br>Digital breast tomosynthesis is an emerging technology. One study on the test characteristics of DBT as a primary breast cancer screening strategy met the minimum inclusion criteria of the systematic evidence review (that is, the study needed to be conducted in an asymptomatic screening population, use a comprehensive reference standard that applied to both negative and positive test results, and have a minimum 1-year follow-up for negative results to ascertain interval breast cancer not identified by screening). As such, estimates of its test performance are subject to change with additional research. However, the positive predictive value of DBT (when used in conjunction with conventional digital mammography and calculated as the number of true positives [cancer] out of all positive examinations) ranges from 4.6% to 10.1% in U.S. studies.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a><br><br> Some information is available about the diagnostic test characteristics of adjunctive screening in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram. Handheld breast ultrasonography has the most evidence available (5 studies); its sensitivity to detect breast cancer ranges from 80% to 83%, and its specificity ranges from 86% to 94%, with a positive predictive value between 3% and 8%. Three small studies of MRI in high-risk women found that its sensitivity to detect breast cancer ranged from 75% to 100%, specificity ranged from 78% to 89%, and positive predictive value ranged from 3% to 33%, although the applicability of these studies to women in the general screening population is limited because of the highly selected population in these studies.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Primary Screening With Conventional Mammography</h4>\r\nAn updated meta-analysis by Nelson and colleagues of RCTs of screening mammography found similar RR reductions in breast cancer mortality by age group as the previous USPSTF evidence review. The combined RRs were 0.88 (CI, 0.73 to 1.003) for women aged 39 to 49 years, 0.86 (CI, 0.68 to 0.97) for women aged 50 to 59 years, 0.67 (CI, 0.55 to 0.91) for women aged 60 to 69 years, and 0.80 (CI, 0.51 to 1.28) for women aged 70 to 74 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3\">3</a> <br><br>None of the trials nor the combined meta-analysis demonstrated a difference in all-cause mortality with screening mammography.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a> <br><br>Observational studies of screening mammography reported a wide range of breast cancer mortality reduction rates. Recent meta-analyses from the EUROSCREEN Working Group showed an approximate 25% to 31% relative reduction in breast cancer deaths in women aged 50 to 69 years who were invited to screening. In comparison, meta-analysis of RCTs that used an intention-to-treat analysis found a 19% to 22% breast cancer mortality reduction in women in the same age range.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3\">3</a><br><br> Updated decision models performed by CISNET yielded somewhat higher estimates in lifetime relative breast cancer mortality reductions with biennial mammography screening in women aged 50 to 74 years compared with previous analyses (median reduction, 25.8% vs. 21.5%; range across models, 24.1% to 31.8% vs. 20.0% to 28.0%, respectively). Since its previous analysis, CISNET has revised the inputs of each of its 6 models (for example, portraying distinct molecular subtypes and including digital mammography), which may account for some of the difference.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;The updated estimate of the mortality benefit of mammography is also higher than that obtained via meta-analysis of randomized trials for a similar age group (24.1% to 31.8% for women aged 50 to 74 years in decision models vs. 19% to 22% for women aged 50 to 69 years in RCTs).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;One reason for the discrepancy is the difference in the time horizon evaluated; whereas the meta-analysis looked at the impact of screening across a single decade, the decision models evaluated the impact of screening across an entire life span. It is also important to recognize that the decision models assumed perfect (100%) adherence to screening, follow-up for abnormal findings, and treatment of screen-detected breast cancer for every patient. In addition, the models also assumed that all women receive the most effective, stage-specific treatments available for their breast cancer once it is detected by mammography. As such, the decision models represent an ideal, or the absolute maximum benefit, that a screening mammography program could achieve given no barriers to the delivery of health care services. In reality, the magnitude of benefit would be lower, given the real-world constraints of implementing a preventive service to such a large proportion of women in the United States. <br><br>In addition to mortality, other outcomes&mdash;such as quality of life or reduction in advanced-stage disease and any associated treatment-related morbidity&mdash;are also important to consider when evaluating the potential benefits of a screening program. From RCT evidence, meta-analysis indicated a reduced risk for advanced cancer with the use of screening mammography in women aged 50 years or older when &ldquo;advanced disease&rdquo; was defined by the most severe categories available (stages III and IV disease, tumor size &ge;50 mm, or &ge;4 positive lymph nodes) (RR, 0.62 [CI, 0.46 to 0.83]). A significant reduction in advanced disease was not observed with the use of screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;Data from observational evidence have shown mixed results; some studies showed an association between screening and reduced lymph node&ndash;positive disease or smaller tumor size,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;whereas others found no evidence of a change in advanced cancer rates as a result of mammography screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation27\">27</a> <br><br>The effect of screening mammography on associated adverse effects of treatment or their intensity is not clear from the literature. A meta-analysis of 5 RCTs showed that women randomly assigned to screening mammography were significantly more likely to have a mastectomy (RR, 1.20 [CI, 1.11 to 1.30]) and surgical therapy (mastectomy and lumpectomy combined) (RR, 1.35 [CI, 1.26 to 1.44]) than women in the control groups.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation36\">36</a>&nbsp;However, critics have noted that these trials do not reflect modern treatment standards and may therefore not represent current practices. Four case-series included in the systematic evidence review compared breast cancer treatments in women who had previous mammography screening with those who did not and reported significantly more breast-conserving surgeries, fewer mastectomies, and less chemotherapy in women who had prior screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;However, all of these studies included women with DCIS in the denominator of screened women treated for cancer, leading to potential bias between the screened and nonscreened groups based on differences in how DCIS and invasive breast cancer are managed.\r\n<h4>Primary Screening With DBT</h4>\r\nNo studies evaluated the effect of screening for breast cancer with DBT on important health outcomes, such as mortality, treatment-related morbidity, or quality of life.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a> <br><br>Two case-series comparing conventional digital mammography versus DBT plus conventional digital mammography reported detection rates by cancer stage. One study (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 29,080) was conducted in the United States and the other (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 12,631) was conducted in Norway. Neither found significant differences in breast cancer size or node status at the time of diagnosis.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation37\">37</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation38\">38</a> <br><br>Some evidence is available about the effect of DBT on recall rates for positive findings requiring additional evaluation. Nine studies compared findings from a single cohort of women undergoing 2 types of screening examinations or compared 2 screening cohorts of women (conventional digital mammography alone vs. combined with DBT). In the single study that met inclusion criteria for the systematic review, DBT combined with digital mammography was associated with a 0.6% reduction in immediate recall rates compared with digital mammography alone (recall rate, 3.6% and 4.2%, respectively). Overall, across all available studies, DBT was associated with a median reduction in immediate recall rates of 1.7% (range, 0.6% to 7.2%).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>\r\n<h4>Adjunctive Screening in Women With Dense Breasts</h4>\r\nNo studies evaluated the effects of adjunctive screening with any method in women with dense breasts on breast cancer rates, quality of life, or mortality.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Primary Screening With Conventional Mammography</h4>\r\nScreening mammography has several potential harms. The most common is a false-positive result, which can lead to psychological harms, as well as additional testing and invasive follow-up procedures. Studies show a fairly consistent association between a false-positive screening mammogram and increased breast cancer&ndash;specific distress, anxiety, and apprehension, particularly in women who have an associated procedure, such as fine-needle aspiration or breast biopsy. These effects improve over time for most women.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation4\">4</a><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab5\">Table 5</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>summarizes BCSC data on the cumulative probability of a woman (at varying starting ages and intervals) receiving at least 1 false-positive mammogram or a recommendation for what turns out to be a false-positive biopsy over a 10-year period.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation39\">39</a> <br><br>The most serious harm of screening mammography is the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer that would never have become a threat to a woman&rsquo;s health, or even apparent, during her lifetime (overdiagnosis and overtreatment). Overdiagnosis occurs when the breast tumor does not progress or when the woman dies of a competing cause of death before the breast cancer advances to the point of causing symptoms. Overdiagnosis is not the same as misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosis is when a cancer is incorrectly classified by an individual pathologist; overdiagnosis, on the other hand, happens when there is general agreement by pathologists on how to classify the cancer, but the tumor does not go on to behave as expected based on its appearance. It is not possible to directly observe for any individual woman whether she has or does not have an overdiagnosed tumor; it is only possible to indirectly estimate the frequency of overdiagnosis that may occur across a screened population. Researchers have used multiple data sources to attempt to quantify overdiagnosis rates associated with mammography screening, including RCTs, pathology and imaging studies, ecologic and cohort studies, and decision modeling. To additionally complicate matters, there is a lack of consensus concerning the optimal method for calculating the magnitude of overdiagnosis, and investigators differ in their approaches.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation6\">6</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation40\">40</a>&nbsp;This has resulted in a wide range of estimates in the available literature (0% to 54%).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation4\">4</a> <br><br>Of the available clinical trials, 3 RCTs in which there was no mammography screening of the control groups at the end of the study (Malm&ouml; Mammographic Screening Trial I and the Canadian National Breast Screening Study 1 and 2) provided the least-biased estimates, as they had the advantage of having comparable groups at baseline, adequate follow-up beyond the screening period to distinguish between earlier diagnosis and overdiagnosis, and clear distinction between which groups received screening and which did not (if screening was also provided to the control group, then overdiagnosis could also occur in this population).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;These older trials likely underestimate the actual magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with modern screening mammography programs, given the increasing sensitivity of newer technologies, but together, they suggest that over a 10-year period, approximately 19% of breast cancers are overdiagnosed.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;CISNET decision models also investigated the degree of overdiagnosis likely to result from a screening mammography program. The 6 decision models reported a wide range of estimates of the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with screening mammography (1.4% to 24.9% of invasive cancer and 30.5% to 84.5% of DCIS, depending on the screening strategy).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;Assumptions in several of the models may have increased the likelihood of underestimating the true burden of overdiagnosis associated with screening mammography. Most importantly, 4 of the 6 models assumed that all diagnosed invasive cancer can progress to lethality; only 1 (model W) allowed for the possibility of cancer with &ldquo;limited malignant potential,&rdquo; whereby the tumor stops progressing at an early invasive stage. In addition, 1 of the models omitted DCIS. <br><br>Recurrent radiation exposure from a lifetime program of mammography screening may slightly increase the risk for breast cancer, although no empirical studies have directly measured this effect. Simulation models performed in support of this recommendation estimate that the mean lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of radiation-induced breast cancer from biennial screening mammography in women aged 50 to 74 years is 3 cases per 10,000 women screened. The mean LAR of breast cancer death is 0.5 deaths per 10,000 women screened. If biennial screening begins at age 40 instead of 50 years, the mean LAR of developing breast cancer increases to 4 cases per 10,000 women screened, and the number of breast cancer deaths increases to about 1 per 10,000 women screened.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation25\">25</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation26\">26</a>Of note, women with large breasts, who may require extra views&mdash;and thus higher radiation doses&mdash;for complete mammography examination, seem to be at increased risk for radiation-induced breast cancer or breast cancer death. Based on information from the Digital Mammography Imaging Screening Trial (which compared the test characteristics of film vs. digital mammography),<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation41\">41</a>&nbsp;as no representative population-based data are available, an estimated 5% to 6% of U.S. women will require additional views during screening for complete breast examination. For biennial screening in women aged 50 to 74 years, the mean LAR of developing breast cancer is an estimated 6 versus 2 cases per 10,000 screened women with and without large breasts, respectively; the mean LAR of breast cancer death is 1 versus 0.4 deaths per 10,000 screened women with and without large breasts, respectively.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation25\">25</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation26\">26</a>\r\n<h4>Primary Screening With DBT</h4>\r\nCurrently, DBT is most frequently performed in combination with conventional digital mammography; this practice essentially doubles the resulting radiation exposure to the patient. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a method to generate synthetic reconstructions of 2-dimensional images from 3-dimensional views, which reduces the total radiation dose emitted. However, study data on the performance of DBT in isolation (that is, with synthetic reconstruction of 2-dimensional views) is limited to 1 mammography reading study that compared sensitivity and specificity and 1 prospective clinical trial,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation42\">42</a>&nbsp;and the method is not yet thought to be in widespread clinical use.<br><br> Limited evidence suggests that DBT may slightly increase the risk for breast biopsy compared with conventional digital mammography. In 4 U.S. studies of DBT that reported breast biopsy rates, 3 noted higher rates in the combined DBT and conventional digital mammography group compared with conventional digital mammography alone (median difference, 0.2% [range, &minus;0.1% to 0.4%]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>\r\n<h4>Adjunctive Screening in Women With Dense Breasts</h4>\r\nAlthough evidence is limited, the use of adjunctive screening in women with increased breast density via alternative technologies, such as handheld ultrasonography or MRI, generally seems to increase recall and breast biopsy rates compared with standard screening mammography alone.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;A single good-quality U.S. study that evaluated the use of adjunctive handheld ultrasonography and MRI found that the recall rate for handheld ultrasonography after a negative mammogram was about 14% compared with 11% for primary screening mammography alone. In women who received adjunctive screening with MRI after a negative mammogram and negative ultrasound, the recall rate was 23%.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation43\">43</a>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nFor women who are not known to be at increased risk for breast cancer, the value of screening mammography increases with age, with the greatest benefit occurring from ages 50 to 74 years. In particular, women aged 60 to 69 years are the most likely to avoid a breast cancer death. Screening women every 2 years provides the best balance of benefit and harms. For women aged 40 to 49 years, the potential benefit is smaller, and the risk for harms is proportionally greater. However, the potential outcomes that need to be considered are not identical, and individual women may differ in how they prioritize them. The small probability that a woman may avoid a breast cancer death must be weighed against the more likely scenario that she may have a false-positive result and possible unnecessary follow-up testing (including invasive testing); a false-negative result, with false reassurance or delayed diagnosis; or most critically, diagnosis and treatment of cancer that would otherwise not have threatened her health or even come to her attention. Women who value the possible breast cancer mortality benefit more than they value avoiding the harms can make an informed decision to begin screening. For women aged 75 years or older, evidence is very limited concerning the benefits and harms of screening mammography. However, since the mortality benefits of screening mammography (as with almost any cancer screening test) generally take years to accrue but many of the harms can be experienced immediately, women with limited life expectancy or severe comorbid conditions are unlikely to benefit.Digital breast tomosynthesis is an emerging technology for breast cancer screening. Preliminary evidence suggests that it can reduce recall rates for false-positive results and detect more cancer compared with conventional digital mammography. However, it may increase breast biopsy rates, and as currently practiced in most settings, DBT exposes women to more radiation than conventional 2-dimensional mammography. It is not clear whether all of the extra cancer cases detected by DBT actually represent a benefit (that is, cancer that is clinically significant rather than overdiagnosis, and of any additional benefit compared with detection by conventional digital mammography at the next scheduled examination). Most importantly, no studies assessed the effect of DBT on important health outcomes for women, such as quality of life, morbidity, or mortality. Finally, increased breast density is a common condition that imparts some increased risk for breast cancer, and it reduces the test performance characteristics of mammography as well. Current evidence on the use of adjunctive screening in women with increased breast density is not sufficient to recommend a specific screening strategy. These are important areas for future research.\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\nThis recommendation updates the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on breast cancer screening with an assessment of the most current available scientific evidence for mammography screening. In addition, this update also provides additional clarity on what is meant by the &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation for women aged 40 to 49 years. A &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation is not a recommendation&nbsp;<em>against</em>&nbsp;mammography screening in this age group; it signifies moderate certainty of a net benefit for screening that is small in magnitude. A &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation emphasizes that the decision to screen should be an individual one, made after a woman weighs the potential benefit against the possible harms. This recommendation also notes that women aged 40 to 49 years with a first-degree relative (parent, child, or sibling) with breast cancer may potentially benefit more than average-risk women in this age group from beginning screening mammography before age 50 years.The USPSTF did not update its recommendation on whether there are additional, incremental benefits or harms associated with the use of MRI or digital mammography instead of film mammography in women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer, given that digital mammography has now essentially replaced film mammography as the primary breast cancer screening method in the United States. The USPSTF did not update its 2009 recommendation on teaching breast self-examination; the USPSTF supports all patients being aware of changes in their bodies and discussing these changes with clinicians. The USPSTF also did not update its recommendation on the additional potential benefit of clinical breast examination.This recommendation examines the evidence of the effectiveness of an emerging technology&mdash;DBT&mdash;as a primary screening strategy. It also evaluates the effectiveness of adjunctive screening using ultrasonography, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative mammogram.The scope of the evidence review supporting this recommendation statement was determined after public comment on the draft research plan.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 21 April through 18 May 2015. In response to the comments received, the USPSTF clarified certain terminology (for example, DBT and misdiagnosis vs. overdiagnosis), updated or added references (for example, those related to the long-term outcomes of DCIS), and provided additional context around the potential risks of radiation exposure due to mammography screening. Additional discussion of the public comments is below.\r\n<h4>Benefits of Contemporary Screening Mammography</h4>\r\nSome commenters thought that the USPSTF did not consider the available observational evidence on the effectiveness of mammography screening, and that the USPSTF&rsquo;s assessment is therefore based on outdated information, resulting in an underestimate of the current benefits of screening. This is incorrect. The systematic evidence review, which served as the foundation for this recommendation statement, encompassed both RCTs and nonexperimental studies of mammography screening. Nearly 200 observational studies, including 83 that specifically evaluated the benefits of screening mammography, were captured in the review.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>The USPSTF agrees that more contemporary evidence on breast cancer screening is important to consider given the age of the available RCTs, and it reviewed both the recent Pan-Canadian<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation44\">44</a>&nbsp;and the Swedish Mammography Screening in Young Women<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation45\">45</a>cohort studies. As noted in the Discussion section, RCTs of mammography screening have generally found smaller relative reductions in breast cancer mortality than observational studies, although estimates from the latter vary. For example, meta-analyses of mammography screening in women aged 50 to 69 years showed RRs of breast cancer death ranging from 0.78 to 0.81 in RCTs compared with about 0.69 to 0.75 in observational studies.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;There may be several reasons for this difference in the magnitude of benefit. Improvements in mammography technology may be translating into an increased mortality benefit, so that more recent observational evidence demonstrates a real difference in the efficacy of modern-day screening compared with that of the older randomized trials. However, known and important methodological limitations of observational studies, such as selection bias, lead and length time bias, and residual or unknown bias and confounding, are likely explanations for some or even all of the difference observed. In the absence of a modern-day clinical trial, it is impossible to know with certainty the precise magnitude of benefit of current screening mammography programs. As such, the USPSTF believes it is most appropriate to consider all of the evidence available (given that it meets prespecified and transparent quality standards, such as those delineated in its commissioned systematic evidence review),<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;while acknowledging that uncertainty remains about the exact size of the anticipated benefit in either direction.\r\n<h4>Screening Mammography in Women Aged 40 to 49 Years</h4>\r\nSome commenters incorrectly believed that the &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation for women aged 40 to 49 years represented a change from what the USPSTF had recommended in the past. Others thought that the &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation meant that the USPSTF was recommending against screening in this group of women. As noted previously, the recommendation for women aged 40 to 49 years was also a &ldquo;C&rdquo; in 2009 (meaning that the USPSTF had concluded that it had moderate certainty of a small net benefit to mammography screening in this population). This update clarifies the language around what the &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation means. It is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a recommendation against screening but a statement that the decision to undergo screening mammography for women in their 40s should be an informed, individual one, after she weighs the potential benefit against the potential harms.\r\n<h4>Screening Mammography in Women Aged 70 to 74 Years or Older</h4>\r\nSeveral commenters believed that the USPSTF was inconsistent in extending a &ldquo;B&rdquo; recommendation to women aged 70 to 74 years but assigning an &ldquo;I&rdquo; statement to women aged 75 years or older. These commenters noted that although the USPSTF had explained that trial data were inconclusive for women in their early 70s, modeling data could support extending the benefit seen in younger women to this age range. However, the USPSTF had stated that modeling data were not sufficient to establish the benefits of mammography screening in women aged 75 years or older. This is an apparent, though not real, contradiction. Two RCTs of mammography screening included participants aged 70 to 74 years. A meta-analysis performed to support the 2002 USPSTF recommendations found that the RR reduction of breast cancer death in screened women aged 65 to 74 years was 0.78 (CI, 0.62 to 0.99).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation35\">35</a>&nbsp;In 2009 and 2014, the meta-analyses were restricted to women aged 70 to 74 years. In the most recent update, the meta-analysis showed an RR reduction of 0.80 (CI, 0.51 to 1.28),<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;and the CI widened and crossed 1.0 because of the small number of absolute participants included in the analysis. The USPSTF considered the trial data, which were suggestive but not definitive, showing a benefit to mammography in this age group within the context of the modeling data, which also suggested an absolute breast cancer mortality benefit (with reasonable additional harms) with the extension of screening to this age group. In women aged 75 years or older, however, direct evidence about the benefits of screening mammography does not exist; no clinical trials of screening include this population.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Therefore, in this case, the USPSTF&rsquo;s assessment could not rest on a foundation of empirical data augmented with supplemental information, but would have to be entirely based on decision modeling. The USPSTF does not use evidence from models alone to establish that a clinical preventive service is effective or harmful; rather, it uses modeling as an important extension that builds on observed evidence.\r\n<h4>Definition of Overdiagnosis</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF received several comments about how overdiagnosis was conceptualized in the recommendation statement. Commenters stressed that it is impossible to directly measure overdiagnosis, and that there are multiple methods for estimating its frequency but no scientific consensus on the optimal approach. The USPSTF agrees, and it discusses these issues in several places throughout the recommendation. Commenters emphasized that because it is not possible to know whether any individual screen-detected cancer would have been clinically detected or gone on to cause health problems in the absence of screening, clinicians treat all detected breast cancer as potentially lethal; again, the USPSTF concurs. Commenters disagreed about the degree of overdiagnosis that is likely to occur with the use of mammography screening, and the USPSTF received requests to emphasize percentages that are both higher and lower than the 19% estimate derived from the trials that did not have screening in their control groups at the end of the study. For the sake of transparency, the USPSTF has provided the full range of overdiagnosis estimates available in the literature as identified in its commissioned systematic evidence review, as well as specific estimates from observational studies, randomized trials, and modeling studies, with the clear caveat that ongoing uncertainty remains. This uncertainty is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;about the fundamental existence of this critical harm of mammography screening,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation46\">46</a>&nbsp;as a few commenters suggested; rather, it is about the precise magnitude of the problem. The USPSTF notes that continuing research is essential to advance understanding of the magnitude of overdiagnosis and how to distinguish overdiagnosed cancer from cancer that is likely to progress, as well as to reduce its occurrence.\r\n<h4>DBT</h4>\r\nSome commenters thought the USPSTF overlooked evidence in its review of the efficacy of DBT. Commenters noted that studies have shown that DBT increases the detection of breast cancer and reduces recalls and false-positive results. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on DBT as a primary screening method for breast cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;The original search identified 945 studies, of which only 13 were identified as specifically relevant to the topic at hand. A bridge search performed during the public comment period to keep the review as temporally current as possible identified another 79 studies, 5 of which directly addressed the test characteristics of DBT. Despite this expansive and meticulous search, a single study met the prespecified inclusion criteria (studies must be conducted in a screening population of asymptomatic women aged 40 years or older and must evaluate test performance characteristics against a comprehensive reference standard that is applied to both negative and positive test results). A &ldquo;comprehensive reference standard&rdquo; means that further imaging and/or biopsy is performed for positive results, and there is a minimum of 1 year of clinical follow-up for negative results in order to accurately assess the interval breast cancer rate (that is, the number of cancers that appear in between screening periods, which allows for the calculation of false-negative results). Even though no other studies met these inclusion criteria, the USPSTF still carefully reviewed the data from all of the studies identified as directly relevant to the use of DBT for primary breast cancer screening, including Friedewald and colleagues' 2014 study that evaluated the performance of DBT in combination with conventional digital mammography.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation47\">47</a>&nbsp;As already noted in the Clinical Considerations section, the USPSTF agrees that preliminary evidence suggests that DBT can reduce recall rates for false-positive results (median reduction, 1.7% [range in the systematic review, 0.6% to 7.2%]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF also agrees that DBT appears to increase the cancer detection rate compared with conventional digital mammography alone. However, the rate of overdiagnosis associated with DBT is unknown; it is also unknown if there is an incremental benefit to finding these cancers earlier than with conventional digital mammography. The USPSTF recommends continued research around this emerging technology.\r\n<h4>Comparison of the USPSTF&rsquo;s Recommendations With Those of Other Organizations</h4>\r\nSome commenters noted that the USPSTF recommendations on breast cancer screening do not align with those of other organizations, such as the American College of Radiology<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation48\">48</a>&nbsp;or the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation49\">49</a>&mdash;both of whom recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40 years&mdash;and were concerned that the lack of conformity may be confusing to clinicians and patients. While there are some differences, it is worth emphasizing the notable similarities in the approach of many major guidelines, including those between the USPSTF&rsquo;s recommendations and the recently released recommendations from the American Cancer Society.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation50\">50</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF stands in agreement with most organizations that mammography screening can reduce deaths due to breast cancer in women in their 40s. Based on the evidence, the USPSTF found that there is a net benefit for women to initiating screening in their 40s, and that the size of the net benefit is smaller than that for older women; it therefore concludes that the decision to begin screening should be an individual one. The American Cancer Society, along with many other groups, including the American College of Physicians,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation51\">51</a>&nbsp;the American Academy of Family Physicians,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation52\">52</a>&nbsp;the 2013 Well-Woman Task Force assembled by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation53\">53</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation54\">54</a>&nbsp;and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation55\">55</a>&nbsp;also recommends individualized decision making for women in their 40s on whether and when to initiate mammography screening. The USPSTF clarified that the risk for breast cancer increases with age (so a 48-year-old woman&rsquo;s potential to benefit may be more similar to a 50- rather than a 40-year-old woman), and that women may wish to factor this information into their decision making as they consider whether and when to initiate screening in their 40s. Notably, the USPSTF is in agreement with all other major professional organizations about the importance of regular mammography screening for women aged 50 to 74 years. The USPSTF found that most of the benefit of mammography screening is realized with biennial screening. The newly released recommendations from the American Cancer Society also support biennial screening, at intervals of 1 to 2 years in women in their 50s, 60s, and 70s.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation50\">50</a>&nbsp;National breast cancer screening programs in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, Germany, Finland, Denmark, and Belgium offer mammography screening every 2 to 3 years for women aged 50 up to 74 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation56\">56</a>&nbsp;Many European countries adhere to recommendations from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which recently updated its guidelines to promote screening starting at age 50 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation57\">57</a>\r\n<h4>Insurance Coverage and Access to Mammography</h4>\r\nSome commenters expressed concern that a &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation from the USPSTF might create a financial barrier for some women in their 40s who wish to undergo mammography screening after making an informed decision. These commenters asked the USPSTF to change its recommendation to a &ldquo;B&rdquo; to guarantee insurance coverage for these women. The Affordable Care Act mandates that persons with private health plans receive coverage without copayment or coinsurance for preventive services that have a USPSTF &ldquo;A&rdquo; or &ldquo;B&rdquo; recommendation.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation58\">58</a> Recommendations from the USPSTF are based on its interpretation of the science regarding the potential benefits and harms of a preventive service; a &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation means that the USPSTF has concluded that there is at least moderate certainty of a small net benefit to the service, whereas a &ldquo;B&rdquo; recommendation means that there is either high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. The USPSTF found in 2009 and again in 2016 that there is moderate certainty of a small net benefit to starting breast cancer screening before age 50 years because of the balance of benefit and harms outlined in this recommendation statement. The USPSTF could not give a &ldquo;B&rdquo; recommendation for screening in women aged 40 to 49 years because the science does not support moderate or high certainty of moderate or substantial net benefit in this age group. The role of the USPSTF is to assess the scientific evidence for preventive services; it is not within its mandate to reinterpret the science and inflate the net benefit of mammography screening solely to ensure insurance coverage of the service for women with private insurance plans.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation59\">59</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that women in their 40s who understand the potential harms of mammography screening but place a higher value on the potential benefit have the option to begin screening. The USPSTF appreciates that, in the absence of full or partial insurance coverage, fewer women may make that choice, but those determinations are made by payers and legislators. Private and public payers have the option of providing coverage (as most do), and legislators have the option of requiring coverage (as they have done in the past and again in the 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation60\">60</a> Some commenters highlighted the importance of coverage without additional payment for women with Medicare or Medicaid. Coverage in these plans does not reflect USPSTF recommendations and is decided separately by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (for Medicare) and by individual states (for Medicaid). Commenters also expressed concern that mammography is currently underutilized in the United States in some settings (for example, rates of recent use among women aged 50 to 74 years do not meet the&nbsp;<em>Healthy People 2020</em>&nbsp;target<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation61\">61</a>) and that any recommendation other than annual mammography screening beginning at age 40 years might &ldquo;drive complacency&rdquo; among women and cause them to delay needed attention to their health. The most recent trend data from the National Committee for Quality Assurance suggest that mammography screening rates have increased among women in all insurance categories since the USPSTF&rsquo;s 2009 recommendation.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation62\">62</a>&nbsp;As with most effective medical interventions, there is the potential for underuse, appropriate use, and overuse of screening mammography in the general population. The USPSTF agrees that effective patient, provider, and systems-level interventions should be employed to increase the appropriate use of screening mammography among women who are most likely to benefit from it, and it feels strongly that women need accurate information about potential benefits and harms so they can make the best decision for themselves.",

Depression is also common in postpartum and pregnant women and affects not only the woman but her child as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening improves the accurate identification of adult patients with depression in primary care settings, including pregnant and postpartum women.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that programs combining depression screening with adequate support systems in place improve clinical outcomes (ie, reduction or remission of depression symptoms) in adults, including pregnant and postpartum women.The USPSTF found convincing evidence that treatment of adults and older adults with depression identified through screening in primary care settings with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both decreases clinical morbidity.The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women with depression.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of screening for depression in adults is small to none.The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of treatment with CBT in postpartum and pregnant women is small to none.The USPSTF found that second-generation antidepressants (mostly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) are associated with some harms, such as an increase in suicidal behaviors in adults aged 18 to 29 years and an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults older than 70 years, with risk increasing with age; however, the magnitude of these risks is, on average, small. The USPSTF found evidence of potential serious fetal harms from pharmacologic treatment of depression in pregnant women, but the likelihood of these serious harms is low. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the overall magnitude of harms is small to moderate.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with at least moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening for depression in adults, including older adults, who receive care in clinical practices that have adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up after screening.

      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adults 18 years and older. It does not apply to children and adolescents, who are addressed in a separate USPSTF recommendation statement (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends screening in all adults regardless of risk factors. However, a number of factors are associated with an increased risk of depression. Among general adult populations, prevalence rates vary by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, geographic location, and employment status. Women, young and middle-aged adults, and nonwhite persons have higher rates of depression than their counterparts, as do persons who are undereducated, previously married, or unemployed. Other groups who are at increased risk of developing depression include persons with chronic illnesses (eg, cancer or cardiovascular disease), other mental health disorders (including substance misuse), or a family history of psychiatric disorders.Among older adults, risk factors for depression include disability and poor health status related to medical illness, complicated grief, chronic sleep disturbance, loneliness, and a history of depression. However, the presence or absence of risk factors alone cannot distinguish patients with depression from those without depression.Risk factors for depression during pregnancy and postpartum include poor self-esteem, child-care stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress, decreased social support, single/unpartnered relationship status, history of depression, difficult infant temperament, previous postpartum depression, lower socioeconomic status, and unintended pregnancy.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nCommonly used depression screening instruments include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) in various forms and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales in adults, the Geriatric Depression Scale in older adults, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in postpartum and pregnant women. All positive screening results should lead to additional assessment that considers severity of depression and comorbid psychological problems (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, or substance abuse), alternate diagnoses, and medical conditions.\r\n<h3>Screening Timing and Interval</h3>\r\nThere is little evidence regarding the optimal timing for screening. The optimum interval for screening for depression is also unknown; more evidence for all populations is needed to identify ideal screening intervals. A pragmatic approach in the absence of data might include screening all adults who have not been screened previously and using clinical judgment in consideration of risk factors, comorbid conditions, and life events to determine if additional screening of high-risk patients is warranted.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nEffective treatment of depression in adults generally includes antidepressants or specific psychotherapy approaches (eg, CBT or brief psychosocial counseling), alone or in combination. Given the potential harms to the fetus and newborn child from certain pharmacologic agents, clinicians are encouraged to consider CBT or other evidence-based counseling interventions when managing depression in pregnant or breastfeeding women.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force, which makes evidence-based recommendations on preventive services for community populations, recommends collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders as part of a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses case managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists. More information about the Community Preventive Services Task Force and its recommendations on depression interventions is available on its website (<a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/\">http://www.thecommunityguide.org</a><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer\">This link goes offsite.

      "other": "<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends that screening be implemented with adequate systems in place. &ldquo;Adequate systems in place&rdquo; refers to having systems and clinical staff to ensure that patients are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to a setting that can provide the necessary care. These essential functions can be provided through a wide range of different arrangements of clinician types and settings. In the available evidence, the lowest effective level of support consisted of a designated nurse who advised resident physicians of positive screening results and provided a protocol that facilitated referral to evidence-based behavioral treatment.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;At the highest level, support included screening; staff and clinician training (1- or 2-day workshops); clinician manuals; monthly training lectures; academic detailing; materials for clinicians, staff, and patients; an initial visit with a nurse specialist for assessment, education, and discussion of patient preferences and goals; a visit with a trained nurse specialist for follow-up assessment and ongoing support for medication adherence; a visit with a trained therapist for CBT; and a reduced copayment for patients referred for psychotherapy.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation3\">3</a> Multidisciplinary team&ndash;based primary care that includes self management support and care coordination has been shown to be effective in management of depression. These components of primary care are detailed in recommendations from the Community Preventive Services Task Force.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;It recommends collaborative care for the treatment of major depression in adults 18 years and older on the basis of strong evidence of effectiveness in improving short-term treatment outcomes. As defined, collaborative care and disease management of depressive disorders include a systematic, multicomponent, and team-based approach that &ldquo;strengthens and supports self-care, while assuring that effective medical, preventive, and health maintenance interventions take place&rdquo; to improve the quality and outcome of patient care.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation4\">4</a>\r\n<h3>Costs</h3>\r\nThe economic burden of depression is substantial for individuals as well as society. Costs to an individual may include emotional suffering, reduced quality of personal relationships, possible adverse effects from treatment, cost of mental health and medical visits and medications, time away from work and lost wages, and cost of transportation. Costs to society may include loss of life, reduced productivity (because of both diminished capacity while at work and absenteeism from work), and increased costs of mental health and medical care.\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nGaps in the evidence on screening for depression in older adults in primary care include a lack of information from large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in settings that are applicable to the US population. More research is needed on the accuracy of screening tools in languages other than English and Spanish and to identify the timing and optimal screening interval in all populations. Data are lacking on both the accuracy of screening and the benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant women, as well as for the balance of benefits and harms of treatment with antidepressants in postpartum women. Finally, research is needed to assess barriers to establishing adequate systems of care and how these barriers can be addressed.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and significant health care problem. It is the leading cause of disability among adults in high income countries and is associated with increased mortality due to suicide and impaired ability to manage other health issues. Depression has a major effect on quality of life for the patient and affects family members, especially children. Depression also imposes a significant economic burden through direct and indirect costs. In the United States, an estimated $22.8 billion was spent on depression treatment in 2009, and lost productivity cost an additional estimated $23 billion in 2011.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation5\">5</a>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2009 recommendation, which focused on the direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for depression in adult populations, including older adults and pregnant and postpartum women. The USPSTF also reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of depression screening instruments and the benefits and harms of depression treatment in these populations.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<h4>General Adult Population and Older Adults</h4>\r\nThe accuracy of screening tests in the general adult population was established in the 2002 and 2009 USPSTF reviews and found to be convincing.\r\n<h4>Pregnant and Postpartum Women</h4>\r\nTwenty-three studies (n = 5398), including 8 studies of the English-language version, compared the accuracy of the EPDS with a diagnostic interview.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;Sensitivity of the English-language EPDS with a cutoff score of 13 ranged from 0.67 (95% CI, 0.18&ndash;0.96) to 1.00 (95% CI, 0.67&ndash;1.00), and specificity for detecting MDD was consistently at least 0.90. In the 2 trials conducted in the United States,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation8\">8</a>including a recent study in low-income African American women, sensitivity for detecting MDD ranged from 0.78 to 0.81. This suggests that the average sensitivity of the EPDS with a cutoff score of 13 in the United States is approximately 0.80, and the positive predictive value for detecting MDD would be 47% to 64% in a population with a 10% prevalence of MDD. The Spanish-language version also showed acceptable performance characteristics. No studies of screening in pregnant and postpartum women with the 9-item PHQ or other versions met inclusion criteria.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nGeneral Adult Population and Older Adults Nine good- or fair-quality trials addressed screening in general adults (5 trials; n = 2924) and older adults (4 trials; n = 890). Seven studies were conducted in the United States, and 2 (in older adults) were conducted in the Netherlands. Most studies were published in the 1990s and early 2000s; only 1 (in older adults) of the 9 trials was published since the previous systematic review. One study in general adults directly compared screening with usual care case-finding,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;while the other studies screened all patients for depression, enrolled only those screening positive, and returned results of screening to clinicians in the intervention group only.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;Studies included a range of additional treatment components along with providing screening result feedback to clinicians. Improvements in remission, response rates, or both in the general adult population ranged from 17% to 87%. Other outcomes were sparsely reported. The effect of screening on remission, response rates, or both in the trials of older adults was minimal. However, both of the trials in older adults that showed a paradoxical effect were conducted in the Netherlands, and the trial with the worst outcomes had a number of features that may have affected its reliability, including external referrals for depression treatment, very low uptake of treatment (19%), and high mortality and morbidity in the intervention group, suggesting that the control and intervention groups may have been different at baseline. The 2009 USPSTF recommendation concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish the benefits of treatment of depression in general adult populations, including older adults.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation10\">10</a>&nbsp;A systematic review of intention-to-treat trials comparing 3 groups of adult patients who received antidepressants, psychotherapy, or a control condition reported a 46% remission rate with antidepressants and a 48% remission rate with psychotherapy after 10 to 16 weeks.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation11\">11</a>&nbsp;Two systematic reviews concluded that antidepressants were effective in treating depression in older adults. In 1 review, older adults who received antidepressants were twice as likely to have remission from major or minor depression as older adults who received placebo (odds ratio [OR], 2.03 [CI, 1.67&ndash;2.46]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation12\">12</a>&nbsp;The other review indicated that among community-dwelling older adults, 36% of those who received antidepressants were in remission at the end of the study compared with 21% of those who received placebo (OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.61&ndash;2.86]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;In addition, 2 good-quality systematic reviews on the efficacy of psychotherapy in older adults found that older adults who received psychotherapy were more than twice as likely to have remission as those who received no treatment (OR, 2.47 [95% CI, 1.76&ndash;3.47] vs 2.63 [95% CI, 1.96&ndash;3.53]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation12\">12</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation14\">14</a> Pregnant and Postpartum Women The USPSTF identified 6 fair- or good-quality trials (n = 11,869) (5 in postpartum women and 1 in pregnant women) that assessed the effect of screening for depression in pregnant and postpartum women.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;Trial participants were identified through primary care settings using the EPDS (cutoff scores varied) and included women with and without depression. None of the trials simply compared usual care with screening plus usual care. Two trials assessed minimal additional intervention beyond screening or feedback of screening results in postpartum<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation15\">15</a>&nbsp;and pregnant<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;women, 2 trials assessed the effects of screening plus provider supports in postpartum women,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation16\">16</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation17\">17</a>&nbsp;and 2 trials assessed feedback of screening results plus adjunctive counseling by home health visitors in postpartum women.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation18\">18</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation19\">19</a>&nbsp;Studies varied by geographical location (United States, northern Europe, United Kingdom, and Hong Kong), length of follow-up (11 weeks to 16 months), and baseline depression rates (10% to 28%). Despite the variation in trial design and population, results were reasonably consistent across the range of designs. Trials in postpartum women showed 28% to 59% reductions in risk of depression at follow-up compared with usual care. The reported effect was smaller (18%) and did not reach significance in the trial of pregnant women but was in the same direction.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;The 4 studies that reported remission or response rates reported significant improvements in both postpartum and pregnant women. The most applicable trial (US trial of screening plus provider supports) found that 45% of intervention participants reported a 5-point or greater reduction in 9-item PHQ score (an improvement considered to be clinically important) compared with 35% percent of usual care participants (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.05&ndash;5.86]; adjusted for depression history, marital status, income, education, age, and degree of parenting stress).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation17\">17</a> Eighteen trials examined the benefits of treatment interventions in women who screened positive for depression in primary care or community settings. Fifteen trials were in postpartum women (usually 6&ndash;12 weeks postpartum) and 3 trials were in pregnant women,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation20\">20-22</a>but all reported outcomes during the postpartum period. Only 1 small, short-term trial of screen-detected depression in postpartum women included antidepressants as an intervention.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation23\">23</a>&nbsp;The most commonly studied approach was CBT or related interventions that included CBT components. All 10 trials of CBT or CBT-related interventions, including the 2 trials in pregnant women, showed an increased likelihood of remission with treatment in the short term (&le;7.8 months). The magnitude of effect in pregnant women was similar to that in postpartum women. Pooled results that used only the longest follow-up period within 1 year showed a 35% increase in the likelihood of remission with CBT (DerSimonian and Laird pooled relative risk, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.19&ndash;1.50]; k = 10;<em>&nbsp;I2&nbsp;</em>= 7.9%) compared with usual care. The other 8 non-CBT studies examined a diverse range of interventions but did not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions for any one approach. There was also insufficient evidence to assess differences in effectiveness for patient subgroups.\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nGeneral Adult Population and Older Adults One trial in general adults reported no adverse events attributable to screening in a subset of participants with newly-identified depression;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation24\">24</a>&nbsp;none of the other effectiveness trials in general adults reported on harms. One trial in older adults reported paradoxical effects from screening, as previously discussed. No additional studies addressing harms of screening were identified in the review. The 2009 USPSTF review found 7 studies that compared suicide-related events in adults who received SSRIs and other second-generation antidepressants vs placebo. No studies reported a significant increase in completed suicide rates in adults who received antidepressants compared with those who received placebo, although completed suicides were rare and, as a result, the power to detect a significant difference was limited.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation25\">25</a>&nbsp;For adults older than 65 years, antidepressant use seemed to be protective against suicidal behavior (OR, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01&ndash;0.58]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation26\">26</a>&nbsp;In addition, the 2009 USPSTF review identified 1 fair-quality study on bleeding risk in older adults who received SSRIs. Although patients 16 years and older were at increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding during SSRI use, the risk increased significantly with age, from 4.1 hospitalizations per 1000 adults aged 65 to 70 years to 12.3 hospitalizations per 1000 adults aged 80 to 89 years. The odds of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults aged 40 to 79 years who were taking SSRIs (adjusted OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 2.1&ndash;4.4]) was much higher when they were also taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (adjusted OR, 15.6 [95% CI, 6.6&ndash;36.6]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation27\">27</a> Pregnant and Postpartum Women Only 1 trial, which focused on the effects of screening alone in postpartum women, specifically reported on adverse effects of screening and found none.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation15\">15</a>&nbsp;None of the other screening trials showed any signals of concern. The literature search did not identify additional trials addressing harms of screening. None of the trials addressing the benefits of behavioral-based interventions reported on harms of treatment. In addition, none of the trials showed paradoxical effects of concern. The review found no additional trials addressing the harms of behavioral-based interventions beyond those that were included for the benefits of treatment. The majority of the evidence on the harms of antidepressants was drawn from a good-quality comprehensive systematic review on the comparative effectiveness and safety of antidepressant treatment for depression in pregnant and postpartum women sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation28\">28</a>&nbsp;This review included studies published between 1996 and 2013 and was supplemented with 12 additional fair- to good-quality observational studies (n = 4,759,435) published after the review.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;The review included 15 observational studies that provided evidence on the harms of antidepressants at unknown dosages in pregnant women with depression and an additional 109 observational studies that provided evidence on the harms of antidepressants in pregnant women whose depression status in either or both treatment groups was unknown. This observational evidence shows that second-generation antidepressant use during pregnancy may be associated with a small increase in risk of preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, miscarriage, perinatal death, preterm birth, serotonin withdrawal syndrome, respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, major malformations, cardiac malformations, and being small for gestational age.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nGeneral Adult Population and Older Adults The evidence from 5 RCTS, in addition to indirect evidence reviewed for the 2009 recommendation, supports moderate certainty that screening for depression in general adults is of moderate net benefit. The evidence for older adults is less clear, because the trials that assessed the direct effect of screening found no benefit and possibly even harm. However, given the strength of the indirect evidence (the accuracy of screening in older adults and the effectiveness of treatment in older adults), the inclusion of adults older than 65 years in the studies of all adults, and the weakness of the direct evidence on screening in older adults, the USPSTF concludes that the weight of evidence still favors a net benefit. However, more research on optimal screening approaches in older adults is imperative. Pregnant and Postpartum Women Direct and indirect evidence support moderate certainty that screening for depression in pregnant and postpartum women is of moderate net benefit. Six RCTs with varying degrees of additional support found direct benefit of screening, 23 studies confirmed the accuracy of the EPDS for identifying MDD, and 10 RCTs found benefit of treatment with CBT.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;Although most of the evidence (except for evidence on harms of SSRIs) is in postpartum women, the direction and magnitude of effect in pregnant women was consistent with the outcomes for postpartum women and for adults in general. It is important to note that the evidence on treatment benefit is primarily for nonpharmacologic interventions (ie, CBT), there is evidence of a small risk of harm to fetal health with SSRI use in pregnant women, and there is a lack of evidence on harms of SSRI use in postpartum women. Therefore, it is important that a range of treatment options are available for pregnant and postpartum women with depression who are identified through screening and that treatment choices are made through shared decision making.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 28, 2015, to August 24, 2015. A number of comments requested a more detailed definition of what constitutes an &ldquo;adequate system&rdquo; for screening. The USPSTF revised the Implementation section to clarify that a range of staff types, organizational arrangements, and settings can be used to support the goals of depression screening and provided a link to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration registry of evidence-based mental health interventions as a resource. Comments suggested that access to depression screening and management resources would be useful. The USPSTF has now provided links to evidence-based depression screening and management toolkits for primary care settings. There were several requests to clarify the potential harms of SSRIs; in response, the USPSTF added information to the Discussion section. Finally, many concerns were expressed about barriers to effectively implementing screening within adequate systems of care; the USPSTF noted this as a research need.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Depression is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Children and adolescents with MDD typically have functional impairments in their performance at school or work, as well as in their interactions with their families and peers. Depression can also negatively affect the developmental trajectories of affected youth. Major depressive disorder in children and adolescents is strongly associated with recurrent depression in adulthood; other mental disorders; and increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion.<br><br>In nationally representative U.S. surveys, about 8% of adolescents reported having major depression in the past year. Little is known about the prevalence of MDD in children. Among children and adolescents aged 8 to 15 years, 2% of males and 4% of females reported having MDD in the past year.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening instruments for depression can accurately identify MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years in primary care settings. The USPSTF found no studies of screening instruments for depression in children aged 11 years or younger in primary care (or comparable) settings and concluded that the evidence is inadequate.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated whether screening for MDD in adolescents in primary care (or comparable) settings leads to improved health and other outcomes.

      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger who do not have a diagnosis of MDD. This recommendation focuses on screening for MDD and does not address screening for other depressive disorders, such as minor depression or dysthymia.\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for MDD in all adolescents but notes that several risk factors might help identify patients who are at higher risk. The causes of MDD are not fully known and likely involve a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Risk factors for MDD in children and adolescents include female sex; older age; family (especially maternal) history of depression; prior episode of depression; other mental health or behavioral problems; chronic medical illness; overweight and obesity; and, in some studies, Hispanic race/ethnicity. Other psychosocial risk factors include childhood abuse or neglect, exposure to traumatic events (including natural disasters), loss of a loved one or romantic relationship, family conflict, uncertainty about sexual orientation, low socioeconomic status, and poor academic performance.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nMany MDD screening instruments have been developed for use in primary care and have been used in adolescents. Two that have been most often studied are the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) and the primary care version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Data on the accuracy of MDD screening instruments in younger children are limited.\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate or recommended screening intervals, and the optimal interval is unknown. Repeated screening may be most productive in adolescents with risk factors for MDD. Opportunistic screening may be appropriate for adolescents, who may have infrequent health care visits.\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\nTreatment options for MDD in children and adolescents include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, collaborative care, psychosocial support interventions, and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. Fluoxetine is approved by the FDA for treatment of MDD in children aged 8 years or older, and escitalopram is approved for treatment of MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The FDA has issued a boxed warning for antidepressants, recommending that patients of all ages who start antidepressant therapy be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Collaborative care is a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses care managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\nIn deciding whether to screen for MDD in children aged 11 years or younger, primary care providers should consider the following issues.\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nLittle is known about the prevalence of MDD in children aged 11 years or younger. The mean age of onset of MDD is about 14 to 15 years. Early onset is associated with worse outcomes. The average duration of a depressive episode in childhood varies widely, from 2 to 17 months.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for MDD in children. The USPSTF concluded that screening itself is unlikely to be associated with significant harms, aside from opportunity costs, labeling and potential stigma associated with a positive result, and referral for further evaluation and treatment.<br><br>The USPSTF concluded, on the basis of a previous review, that the use of SSRIs in children is associated with harms, specifically risk for suicidality. Evidence on the harms of psychotherapy alone or in combination with SSRIs in children is limited. Newer studies provide little additional evidence on treatment harms in children and adolescents but do not suggest more risks. Only 4 studies examined the harms of treatment with SSRIs in children and adolescents. These studies found no increased risk for suicidality associated with antidepressant use, but risk for rare events could not be precisely determined because the studies had limited statistical power. No trials of psychotherapy or combined interventions in children examined harms.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF found no evidence on the current frequency of or methods used in primary care for screening for MDD in children.\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders, based on strong evidence of effectiveness in improving depression symptoms, adherence and response to treatment, and remission and recovery from depression. For this and related recommendations from the Community Preventive Services Task Force, go to<a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/mentalhealth/index.html\">www.thecommunityguide.org/mentalhealth/index.html</a><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer\">This link goes offsite. Click to read the external link disclaimer</a>.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nIn a separate recommendation statement, the USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in primary care settings, including among adolescents (I statement). Other USPSTF recommendations on mental health topics pertaining to children and adolescents, including illicit drug and alcohol use, can be found on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",

      "other": "<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\nMany screening tools are available to identify depression in children and adolescents, and some have been used in primary care. The number of items in each tool, the administrative time required to complete them, and the appropriate ages for screening vary. A positive result on an initial screening test does not necessarily indicate the need for treatment. Screening is usually done in 2 phases: the initial screening is followed by a second phase in which skilled clinicians take into account contextual factors surrounding the patient&rsquo;s current situation, through either additional probing or a formal diagnostic interview. In instances where treatment is recommended, it can be initiated by the screening provider or through referral to another set of treatment providers. A negative result on a screening test, however, does not always preclude referral when clinical judgment or parental concerns suggest it is warranted.<br><br>The USPSTF recommends that screening be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up. Depression can be managed in the primary care or specialist setting or collaboratively in both settings. Treatment options for depression include pharmacologic, behavioral, multimodal, and collaborative care models, some of which require coordination. Finally, inadequate support and follow-up may result in treatment failures or harms, as indicated by the FDA boxed warning. &ldquo;Adequate systems in place&rdquo; refers to having systems and clinical staff to ensure that patients are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to a setting that can provide the necessary care. These essential functions can be provided through a wide range of arrangements of clinician types and settings.\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nThe systematic evidence review identified several critical research gaps, including the need for studies of screening for and treatment of MDD in children younger than 11 years. Large, good-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) are also needed to better understand the overarching effects of screening for MDD on intermediate and long-term health outcomes. It would be helpful to quantify the proportion of persons with screen-detected MDD who are treated or referred as well as their willingness and ability to be assessed and treated.<br><br>The systematic review excluded studies with participants who had comorbid disorders. Children and adolescents with MDD more often have comorbid conditions than those without MDD, particularly in primary care settings. This underscores the importance of additional research in child and adolescent populations that are similar to those found in primary care settings to study the effects of comorbid conditions on screening accuracy, type of MDD treatment selected, and benefits and harms.<br><br>For treatment of MDD, research needs include well-designed studies of psychotherapy and combined treatments, as well as studies of the benefits and harms of other treatments (such as non-SSRI medications and complementary or alternative approaches). For rare events, meta-analyses are needed that include only children and adolescents with MDD and focus on current FDA-approved medications. Studies with long-term follow-up are also needed.",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\nAlthough it is normal for children and adolescents to experience occasional feelings of sadness and other symptoms of depression, those with MDD have 1 or more major depressive episodes that last at least 2 weeks and cause significant functional impairment across social, occupational, or educational domains. In some children and adolescents with MDD, these symptoms may present as periods of disruptive mood and irritability rather than as a sad mood and may last for weeks, months, or even years. Major depressive disorder is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Morbidity in children and adolescents may be demonstrated through decreased school performance, poor social functioning, early pregnancy, increased physical illness, and substance abuse. Depressed adolescents have more psychiatric and medical hospitalizations than those who are not depressed. Children with depressive disorders have increased health care costs (including general medical and mental health care) compared with those without mental health diagnoses or those with other mental health diagnoses (except conduct disorder). Major depressive disorder also increases the risk for suicide. Ten percent of children aged 5 to 12.9 years and 19% of adolescents aged 13 to 17.9 years with MDD attempt suicide.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation2\">2</a> <br><br>The mean age of onset of MDD in childhood and adolescence is about 14 to 15 years, and onset is earlier in girls than boys. In 2 nationally representative U.S. surveys, about 8% of adolescents reported having MDD in the past year. Little is known about the prevalence of the disorder in children. The 2005 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that among children and adolescents aged 8 to 15 years, 2% of males and 4% of females reported having MDD in the past year. However, the prevalence of depression in primary care settings is often higher in studies with community samples of children and adolescents. Only 36% to 44% of children and adolescents with depression receive treatment, suggesting that the majority of depressed youth are undiagnosed and untreated.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2009 recommendation on screening for child and adolescent MDD among primary care populations.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;To focus on the population most likely to benefit from screening and intervention, the scope of the review was narrowed to focus on screening for and treatment of MDD. In addition, studies of paroxetine were excluded because of the 2003 FDA recommendation that it not be used to treat MDD in children and adolescents because of reports of possible suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in children and adolescents receiving paroxetine for depression. As a result, many studies included in the 2009 review were not included in the updated review. The USPSTF examined the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening; the accuracy of primary care&ndash;feasible screening tests; and the benefits and harms of treatment with psychotherapy, medications, and collaborative care models in patients aged 7 to 18 years. Treatment studies were limited to those that were implemented in or received referrals from primary care settings to ensure that the patient population was similar to those who would be identified through screening.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found 5 good- or fair-quality studies of the accuracy of MDD screening instruments in children and adolescents. One study recruited adolescents from a primary care setting and compared the PHQ-A with a full diagnostic interview by a mental health professional. Four studies recruited adolescents from school settings and compared the screening test with a diagnostic interview or a different screening test. One study evaluated the BDI, 1 evaluated the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), 1 evaluated the BDI and the CES-D, and 1 evaluated the Clinical Interview Schedule&ndash;Revised. No studies included children younger than 11 years. <br><br>The PHQ-A study had the highest positive predictive value. The authors did not report a diagnostic cutoff score but reported sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 94% for a positive test result.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation5\">5</a>&nbsp;Results were not stratified by age, sex, or ethnicity. The 2 BDI studies reported sensitivity ranging from 84% to 90% and specificity ranging from 81% to 86% when a cutoff score of 11 was applied.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation6\">6</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;One study<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation7\">7</a>reported a higher area under the curve for males than for females, but neither of the BDI studies reported results by age or ethnicity. <br><br>The CES-D studies used different diagnostic cutoff scores.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;One study enrolled a slightly younger population than the other (age range of 11 to 15 years vs. average age &gt;16 years). Sensitivity ranged from 18% to 84% and specificity ranged from 38% to 83%, depending on the cutoff score used. Results by sex were inconsistent, and neither study stratified results by age or ethnicity. One study evaluated the Clinical Interview Schedule&ndash;Revised.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;The mean age was 15.7 years, and sensitivity and specificity were 18% and 97%, respectively. The study did not report other outcomes or stratify results by age, race, or ethnicity.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Treatment</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found 8 fair- or good-quality RCTs that reported health outcomes in children or adolescents with screen-detected MDD who were treated with SSRIs (4 RCTs), psychotherapy (2 RCTs), SSRIs combined with psychotherapy (1 RCT), or collaborative care (1 RCT). Most trials were restricted to adolescents aged 12 to 14 years or older; only 2 of the SSRI trials included children aged 7 or 8 years. Outcomes included treatment response, which was defined differently across studies; symptom severity; and global functioning. Depression outcomes were reported after 8 to 12 weeks of SSRI treatment or psychotherapy, whereas the collaborative care study reported outcomes at 52 weeks.\r\n<h4>SSRIs</h4>\r\nOne good-quality study (<em>n&nbsp;</em>= 221) compared fluoxetine with placebo in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation10\">10-12</a>&nbsp;Two fair-quality studies (<em>n&nbsp;</em>= 268 and 316) compared escitalopram with placebo in children and adolescents<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;and adolescents only.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation14\">14</a>&nbsp;One fair-quality study (<em>n&nbsp;</em>= 178) compared citalopram with placebo in children and adolescents.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation15\">15</a>&nbsp;The absolute difference in response favored SSRIs in all 4 studies (range, 2.4% to 25%) and was significant in 2 of the 4 trials. When other outcomes, such as symptom severity or global functioning, were reported, they also favored the SSRI group. One trial examined the efficacy of escitalopram by age group (children vs. adolescents) and found that it was superior to placebo in improving depression symptoms, depression symptom severity, and global functioning in adolescents but not children.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;No trials examined efficacy across sex or race/ethnicity subgroups.\r\n<h4>Psychotherapy</h4>\r\nTwo studies evaluated the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with placebo (waitlist control or clinical monitoring) in adolescents with MDD and reported nonsignificant improvements in response (43.2% vs. 34.8%) and recovery (odds ratio [OR], 2.15 [95% CI, 0.87 to 5.33]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation10\">10</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation11\">11</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;Results for remission (16% vs. 17%) did not differ significantly between groups.\r\n<h4>SSRIs Combined With Psychotherapy</h4>\r\nOne CBT study also compared CBT plus fluoxetine with placebo.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation10\">10</a>&nbsp;The CBT plus fluoxetine group showed a 71% response rate versus a 35% response rate in the placebo group, which received a placebo drug and weekly clinical monitoring (<em>P</em>&nbsp;= 0.001).\r\n<h4>Collaborative Care</h4>\r\nOne recent RCT (<em>n&nbsp;</em>= 101) evaluated a 12-month collaborative care intervention in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years who screened positive for depression (60% with MDD) in 9 primary care clinics within 1 health system.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation17\">17</a>&nbsp;The intervention was based on the IMPACT (Improving Mood&ndash;Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment) model and was adapted for adolescents. Patients randomly assigned to the collaborative care group had an initial in-person session that included their parents, choice of treatment type, and regular follow-up with depression care managers (28% received psychotherapy alone, 4% received pharmacotherapy alone, and 54% received both). Patients randomly assigned to the usual care control group received screening results and could access mental health services through the usual health care system. Compared with the control group, patients in the collaborative care group had greater reductions in depressive symptoms at 6 and 12 months (8.5- and 9.4-point reductions on the Children&rsquo;s Depression Rating Scale&ndash;Revised, respectively;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;&lt; 0.0001 for interaction), better response rates (&ge;50% score reduction from baseline) at 12 months (OR, 3.3 [CI, 1.4 to 8.2]) and 6 months (not significant), and higher likelihood of remission at 6 months (OR, 5.2 [CI, 1.6 to 17.3]) and 12 months (OR, 3.9 [CI, 1.5 to 10.6]).\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for MDD in adolescents or children.\r\n<h4>SSRIs</h4>\r\nFive SSRI trials reported on harms and found no significant differences between intervention groups, although none of these studies were powered to detect these differences. Four trials (2 for escitalopram, 1 for citalopram, and 1 for fluoxetine) reported on suicidality (this included worsening suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt; no completed suicides were reported). No studies found significant differences but, again, none were sufficiently powered for this outcome. No studies examined subgroup differences in harms. The USPSTF found no evidence on the long-term (&gt;12 weeks) effects of SSRIs.\r\n<h4>Psychotherapy</h4>\r\nOne CBT trial reported on harms and found no apparent differences in harms-related, suicide-related, or psychiatric adverse events between the CBT and placebo groups.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation10\">10</a>\r\n<h4>SSRIs Combined With Psychotherapy</h4>\r\nThe same trial also reported on the harms of CBT plus fluoxetine versus placebo and found no apparent differences.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation10\">10</a>\r\n<h4>Collaborative Care</h4>\r\nThe single trial of collaborative care found no differences in the number of psychiatric hospitalizations between the intervention and control groups (6% vs. 4%). More patients in the control group had an emergency department visit with a primary psychiatric diagnosis (10% vs. 2%). However, this study was not powered to detect differences.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation17\">17</a>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening tests can accurately identify MDD in adolescents. It also found adequate evidence that treatment of adolescents with screen-detected MDD is associated with beneficial reductions in symptoms. Although the data are limited, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the frequency of medication-related adverse events in adolescents is adequate to estimate that the magnitude of harms of pharmacotherapy is small if patients are closely monitored. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the harms of psychotherapy and collaborative care in adolescents is adequate to estimate that the magnitude of harms is small to none. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years is associated with moderate net benefit.<br><br>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening tests can accurately identify MDD in children and inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment for children with screen-detected MDD. As a result, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation on screening for MDD in children aged 7 to 11 years.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 8 September to 5 October 2015. Many comments focused on the phrase &ldquo;adequate systems.&rdquo; Some commenters requested a more detailed definition of what constitutes an adequate system for screening, others recommended removing the conditional term &ldquo;when,&rdquo; and others recommended that the requirement for adequate systems be stronger. To clarify the recommendation, the USPSTF separated it into 2 statements: one to support screening, and a second to explain how screening should be implemented. The USPSTF also revised the section on implementation to clarify that a range of staff types, organizational arrangements, and settings can support the goals of depression screening.",

      "rationale": "<h3><strong>Importance</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent and significant impairments in social interaction and communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and activities, when these symptoms cannot be accounted for by another condition. In 2010, the prevalence of ASD in the United States was estimated at 14.7 cases per 1000 children, or 1 in 68 children, with substantial variability in estimates by region, sex, and race/ethnicity.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation1\">1</a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Detection</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can detect ASD among children aged 18 to 30 months.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening for ASD in toddlers and preschool-age children for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by family members, other caregivers, or health care professionals. There are no studies that focus on the clinical outcomes of children identified with ASD through screening. Although there are studies suggesting treatment benefit in older children identified through family, clinician, or teacher concerns, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the efficacy of treatment of cases of ASD detected through screening or among very young children. Treatment studies were generally very small, few were randomized trials, most included children who were older than would be identified through screening, and all were in clinically referred rather than screen-detected patients.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found that the harms of screening for ASD and subsequent interventions are likely to be small based on evidence about the prevalence, accuracy of screening, and likelihood of minimal harms from behavioral interventions.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in children aged 18 to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to children who have not been diagnosed with ASD or developmental delay and for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by parents, other caregivers, or health care professionals.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nA number of tests are available for screening for ASD in children younger than 30 months. The most commonly studied tool is the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and its subsequent revisions (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers With Follow-Up [M-CHAT-F] and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers&ndash;Revised, With Follow-Up [M-CHAT-R/F]). The M-CHAT-R/F is a parent-rated scale, and a positive finding leads to a follow-up interview. If the follow-up interview is positive, a full diagnostic workup for ASD is indicated. The screening process assesses communication skills, joint attention, repetitive movement, and pretend play.\r\n<h3>Treatments and Interventions</h3>\r\nTreatments for ASD include behavioral, medical, educational, speech/language, and occupational therapy and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. Treatments for young children in the target age group for routine screening for ASD are primarily behavioral interventions, particularly early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions, which may include approaches incorporating applied behavior analysis principles, parent training components, and play- or interaction-based interventions. Among the behavioral interventions, those based on applied behavior analysis have the highest-quality data supporting their effects on cognitive and language outcomes. These interventions can be delivered in a home or school setting and are generally time-intensive, with some programs requiring up to 40 hours a week.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation2\">2</a>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nAutism spectrum disorder can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges for affected children and place substantial strain on family members and other caregivers. Treatment and maturation may reduce the effects of the core symptoms of ASD for some children, but others may experience long-term effects on education, employment, and ability to live independently.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;It is important that clinicians listen carefully to parents when concerns are raised by the parents or during an examination and make prompt use of validated tools to assess the need for further diagnostic testing and services. Disparities have been observed in the frequency and age at which ASD is diagnosed among children by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and language of origin, creating concern that certain groups of children with ASD may be systematically underdiagnosed.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;It is important to note that an \"I\" statement is not a recommendation for or against screening. In the absence of evidence about the balance of benefits and harms, clinicians should use their clinical judgment to decide if screening in children without overt signs and symptoms is appropriate for the population in their care.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nAlthough there is limited evidence about the harms of screening for ASD in children, reported potential harms include misdiagnosis and the anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result, particularly if confirmatory testing is delayed because of resource limitations. Behavioral treatments are not generally thought to be associated with significant harms but can place a large time and financial burden on the family. Other treatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in this review.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nA 2004 survey of pediatricians in Maryland and Delaware found that 8% screened specifically for ASD.

      "discussion": "<h3><strong>Burden of Disease</strong></h3>\r\nAutism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent and significant impairments in social interaction and communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and activities, when these symptoms cannot be accounted for by another condition. In 2010, the prevalence of ASD in the United States was estimated at 14.7 cases per 1000 children, or 1 in 68 children, with substantial variability in estimates by region, sex, and race/ethnicity.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;This represents a 23% increase from 2008; the reasons for this increase are not completely understood.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation1\">1</a>\r\n<h3><strong>Scope of Review</strong></h3>\r\nThe USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;to evaluate the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and potential harms of brief, formal screening instruments for ASD administered during routine primary care visits, and the benefits and potential harms of early behavioral treatment for children identified with ASD through screening. The review focused on studies of screening in children younger than 3 years who were unselected (ie, not identified because of risk factors or concerns regarding ASD).\r\n<h3><strong>Accuracy of Screening Tests</strong></h3>\r\nSeveral screening tools for ASD are available, but the strongest and most applicable evidence is for the M-CHAT/F and M-CHAT-R/F, 2 versions of the same tool. Both use a parent-rated scale that can lead to a follow-up interview, which, if positive, leads to referral for confirmatory diagnosis by a behavioral or developmental specialist. The initial screening process takes 5 to 10 minutes. Two large, good-quality trials conducted in the United States in children aged 16 to 30 months found similar positive predictive values for these tools (approximately 50%) for the detection of ASD in unselected populations.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation11\">11</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation12\">12</a>&nbsp;The validity of these studies was weakened somewhat by the high dropout rate between screening steps but is still reasonably high for mass screening. There are no data on the specificity or negative predictive value of these screening tools. One study followed up a sample of children who were referred for diagnostic evaluation as a result of screening but not diagnosed with ASD and reported that almost all of these children had another form of developmental delay.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation12\">12</a>&nbsp;It is not known whether early detection of these other problems results in improved health outcomes. Although a number of potential risk factors for ASD have been identified, there is insufficient evidence to determine if certain risk factors modify the performance characteristics of ASD screening tests, such as the age at which screening is performed or other characteristics of the child or family.\r\n<h3><strong>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</strong></h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found no RCTs that directly addressed the overarching question of whether screening for ASD in children 3 years or younger results in improvements to core ASD symptoms, cognitive and intellectual functioning, language and communication skill development, challenging behavior, adaptive behavior, educational placement or achievement, or quality of life for the child and family. The USPSTF found 26 RCTs of early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions (the most often studied treatment for this age group) for ASD in young children. However, assessment of treatment evidence was complicated by the variation among studies in intervention design, method of delivery, comparators, and outcomes measured, as well as by the heterogeneity in the age, types of symptoms, and symptom severity of the children enrolled. Four RCTs reported cognitive and language outcomes for early intensive behavioral interventions delivered by trained clinicians. Three of the 4 trials (including the largest trial, with 294 children) reported that these interventions improved cognitive scores by 11 to 16 points (Mullen Scales of Early Learning or IQ) compared with a range of comparators (calculated from published data).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation13\">13-15</a>&nbsp;The fourth RCT found no effect, but this trial compared different ways of delivering the same intervention.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;The same set of studies showed a similar pattern for language outcomes. Twelve RCTs of play- or interaction-based interventions reported significant improvements in some measures of interaction but not others. The other RCTs evaluated various interventions delivered by parents and found inconsistent or negative results. Studies were very small (most enrolled 20&ndash;40 children), and study quality was generally fair. In addition to the limitations of the evidence in size, study design, and other sources of heterogeneity, it is not clear whether these studies are applicable to children who would be detected through screening. Autism spectrum disorder is a highly heterogeneous condition in terms of onset and course of core clinical ASD symptoms and cognitive and language development.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation17\">17</a>&nbsp;All of the treatment studies were conducted in populations of children with a previous diagnosis of ASD, many of whom were referred from specialized ASD programs. Many of the children enrolled in these studies had significant impairments in cognition, language, and behavior identified through case-finding and were older than the age group for which the screening tools were developed. Children identified through screening rather than through case-finding are likely to be younger and have milder symptoms than those in study populations. It is therefore not clear whether young children with ASD detected by screening and not because of parental or clinician concern will experience similar benefits from earlier intervention.\r\n<h3><strong>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</strong></h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found little evidence on the harms of screening and treatment. Potential harms include misdiagnosis and the time, effort, and anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result. This is of particular concern when there is a delay in confirmatory testing because of resource limitations, which are common.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Even good-quality studies of screening had a high dropout rate between screening steps and between screening and diagnosis, suggesting that the process may be difficult for some families. Behavioral treatments are not generally thought to be associated with significant harms but can place a large time and financial burden on the family. Other treatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in the scope of this review. The USPSTF concludes that the potential harms of screening and behavioral treatment are no greater than small.\r\n<h3><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></h3>\r\nOverall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for ASD in children aged 18 to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by parents, other caregivers, or health care professionals. The USPSTF identified no studies that directly evaluated the benefits or harms of screening for ASD in this age group. Studies on the benefits and harms of treatment were of small size, few were randomized, and all were conducted in populations that may not represent children who would be detected through screening programs alone. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in young children.\r\n<h3><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 4, 2015, to August 31, 2015. Many parents of children with ASD, adults with ASD, and clinicians who care for children with ASD wrote to share their personal experiences and concerns. One major area of concern was a perception that the USPSTF was advocating against screening or against the use of screening tools to follow up on parents&rsquo; concerns. This was not the USPSTF&rsquo;s intention, and the USPSTF will be clear when communicating this recommendation that it is not recommending for or against screening but advocating for more research. In the meantime, clinicians should use their clinical judgment, especially when caring for populations in which case-finding may be difficult because of language, access, or other barriers. Furthermore, clinicians should listen carefully to parents&rsquo; concerns and use validated tools to assess whether further diagnosis or services are needed. Standardized tools, such as the M-CHAT, may be used diagnostically to follow up on concerns expressed by parents. Another area of concern was why studies of test accuracy and the effectiveness of treatment were not sufficient to support screening and what kind of research would be needed to support a positive recommendation. In response, the USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify the lack of treatment studies in the population that would likely be identified through screening and to provide greater detail about the different types of studies that could fill this evidentiary gap. Finally, other comments focused on the low cost and lack of harms associated with screening. The USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify that, while the screening tools are relatively easy to administer and behavioral interventions are generally safe, the potential effects of extended treatment, in the absence of clear benefit, on families in terms of time and resources are not negligible.",

      "clinical": "<h3><a name=\"consider\"></a>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to adults aged 40 years or older without known CVD (including history of MI or stroke) and without increased bleeding risk (for example, history of GI ulcers, recent bleeding, or use of medications that increase bleeding risk).\r\n<h3>Assessment of the Balance of Benefits and Harms</h3>\r\nThe magnitude of the health benefits of aspirin use depends on an individual&rsquo;s baseline CVD risk and willingness to take aspirin for a sufficient duration to obtain the benefit of reduced incidence of CRC. The magnitude of harms depends on the presence of risk factors for bleeding.\r\n<h4>Baseline CVD Risk</h4>\r\nThe magnitude of the cardiovascular risk reduction with aspirin use depends on an individual&rsquo;s initial risk for CVD events. Risk assessment for CVD should include ascertainment of the following risk factors: age, sex, race/ethnicity, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, diabetes, and smoking. An online version of the ACC/AHA risk calculator can be found at <a href=\"http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/\">http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/</a><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer\">This link goes offsite. Click to read the external link disclaimer</a>.\r\n<h4>CRC Prevention</h4>\r\nColorectal cancer prevention plays an important role in the overall health benefit of aspirin, but this benefit is not apparent until 10 years after aspirin therapy is started. Patients need to take aspirin for at least 5 to 10 years to realize this potential benefit,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation6\">6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation7\">7</a> and persons with shorter life expectancy are less likely to benefit. Thus, aspirin use is more likely to have an effect when it is started between the ages of 50 and 59 years. Because of the time required before a reduced incidence in CRC is seen, older persons (that is, 60 years or older) are less likely to realize this benefit than adults aged 50 to 59 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8\">8</a>\r\n<h4>GI and Intracranial Bleeding</h4>\r\nEvidence shows that risk for GI bleeding, with and without aspirin use, increases with age. For this recommendation, the USPSTF considered older age and male sex to be important risk factors for GI bleeding. Other risk factors include upper GI tract pain, GI ulcers, concurrent anticoagulation or NSAID use, and uncontrolled hypertension.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5\">5</a> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy combined with aspirin use increases the risk for serious GI bleeding compared with aspirin use alone.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation9\">9</a> The rate of serious bleeding among aspirin users is about 2 to 3 times greater in patients with a history of GI ulcer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation10\">10</a> The risk for serious GI bleeding is 2 times greater in men than in women.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation10\">10</a> These risk factors increase the risk for bleeding substantially and should be considered in the overall decision about whether to start or continue aspirin therapy. There is no evidence that enteric-coated or buffered formulations reduce the risk for serious GI bleeding.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation2\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation11\">11</a>\r\n<h4>Balance of Benefits and Harms</h4>\r\nThe USPSTF used a CVD microsimulation model to estimate cardiovascular event rates based on baseline risk factors and aspirin use. It used the AHA/ACC risk calculator to stratify findings of benefits and harms by 10-year CVD risk. The USPSTF also calculated estimates of CRC incidence and harms of bleeding to determine the net balance of benefits and harms across individuals with varying baseline CVD risk.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8\">8</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation12\">12<br><br></a><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2\">Table 2</a> present the USPSTF&rsquo;s estimated lifetime number of nonfatal MIs, ischemic strokes, and cases of CRC prevented, stratified by 10-year CVD risk level, age, and sex, among adults aged 50 to 69 years (the age range with evidence of net benefit from aspirin use). In addition, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2\">Table 2</a> present the USPSTF&rsquo;s estimated lifetime number of GI bleeding events and hemorrhagic strokes. The USPSTF developed these estimates assuming that aspirin users are not taking NSAIDs and do not have other conditions that increase risk for GI bleeding. The USPSTF estimated life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved as one part of its consideration of the balance of benefits and harms of these disparate clinical outcomes (see the Implementation section for more information on interpreting the results in <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2\">Table 2</a>).<br><br>Overall, the USPSTF determined that the greatest net benefit to be gained is by adults aged 50 to 59 years whose 10-year CVD risk is 10% or greater. The USPSTF recommends that persons in this age and risk group start taking aspirin. Adults aged 60 to 69 years may also benefit from starting aspirin use, although the net benefit is smaller due to the increased risk for GI bleeding and decreased benefit in CRC prevention in this age group.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8\">8<br><br></a>Further, the decision about the level of CVD risk at which the potential benefits outweigh potential harms is an individual one. Some adults may decide that avoiding an MI or a stroke is very important and that having a GI bleeding event is not as significant. They may decide to take aspirin at a lower CVD risk level than those who are more concerned about GI bleeding. Adults who have a high likelihood of benefit with little potential for harm should be encouraged to consider aspirin use. Conversely, adults who have little potential for benefit or are at high risk for GI bleeding should be discouraged from it.\r\n<h3>Treatment and Dosage</h3>\r\nThe optimal dose of aspirin to prevent CVD events is not known. Primary prevention trials have demonstrated benefits with various regimens, including doses of 75 and 100 mg per day and 100 and 325 mg every other day. A dose of 75 mg per day seems as effective as higher doses. The risk for GI bleeding may increase with the dosage. A pragmatic approach consistent with the evidence is to prescribe 81 mg per day, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the United States.<br><br>Although the optimal timing and frequency of discussions about aspirin therapy are unknown, a reasonable approach may be to assess CVD and bleeding risk factors starting at age 50 years and periodically thereafter, as well as when CVD and bleeding risk factors are first detected or change.\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nEvidence from primary prevention trials on the benefits of initiating aspirin use in adults younger than 50 years is limited. The potential benefit is probably lower than in adults aged 50 to 69 years because the risk for CVD events is lower (only a small percentage of adults younger than 50 years have a 10-year CVD risk &ge;10%).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8\">8</a>Adults younger than 50 years who have an increased 10-year CVD risk may gain significant benefit from aspirin use; how much benefit is uncertain.Evidence on the benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in older adults is limited. Many adults aged 70 years or older are at increased risk for CVD because of their age. They have a high incidence of MI and stroke; thus, the potential benefit of aspirin could be substantial.\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nThe relationship between older age and GI bleeding is well-established; thus, the potential harms for adults older than 70 years are significant. The complexity of risk factors, medication use, and concomitant illness make it difficult to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in this age group. In addition, aspirin use in adults older than 70 years results in smaller reductions in the incidence of CRC compared with younger adults.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nNearly 40% of U.S. adults older than 50 years use aspirin for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5\">5</a> A study of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data assessed how common aspirin use is for the primary prevention of CVD and whether physicians recommend it or patients start it on their own. Among patients who were eligible for aspirin therapy and were at increased CHD risk (&gt;10% 10-year risk), about 41% were told by a physician to take aspirin. Among patients aged 65 years or older who were told by a physician to take aspirin, 80% adhered to the recommendation.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation13\">13</a>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF has made other recommendations on CVD prevention, including smoking cessation and promoting a healthful diet and physical activity, as well as screening for carotid artery stenosis, CHD, high blood pressure, lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes, and peripheral artery disease. In addition, it has made recommendations on screening for CRC. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nMillion Hearts (<a href=\"http://www.millionhearts.hhs.gov/\">www.millionhearts.hhs.gov</a>) is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. It aims to prevent heart disease and stroke by improving access to effective care, improving the quality of care for the &ldquo;ABCS&rdquo; (aspirin when appropriate, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation), focusing clinical attention on the prevention of heart attack and stroke, and activating the public to lead a heart-healthy lifestyle.<br><br>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several intervention strategies to prevent CVD for communities and health care organizations (available at <a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/\">www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/</a>). For health care systems, it recommends introducing clinical decision-support systems to implement clinical guidelines at the point of care. For insurers and payers, it recommends reducing out-of-pocket costs to patients for medications to control high blood pressure and high cholesterol. For clinicians and health care organizations, it recommends incorporating multidisciplinary team-based care to improve blood pressure control, including patients, primary care providers, and other professionals (such as nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, social workers, and community health workers).",

The systematic review on aspirin use to prevent CVD is an update of the 2009 USPSTF review.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation2\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation14\">14</a> The systematic review on aspirin use to prevent CRC is an update of the 2007 USPSTF review.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation6\">6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation7\">7</a> The systematic review on aspirin use to prevent cancer other than CRC is new.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation7\">7</a> A review of potential harms was incorporated across all 3 systematic reviews.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5\">5</a> The primary studies of interest for all reviews focused on primary prevention of CVD. Findings from the 3 coordinated systematic reviews were integral to determining the parameters and assumptions used in the decision-analysis model, which was used to estimate net benefit for the recommendation.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8\">8</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation12\">12</a>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Risk Assessment and Preventive Medication</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF used a calculator derived from the 2013 ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations to estimate CVD risk thresholds.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation3\">3</a> The USPSTF selected this tool because of its broader focus on CVD outcomes (combining both cerebrovascular and cardiovascular outcomes), its external validation in various U.S. populations, and its reasonable performance in studies. The calculator predicts 10-year risk for a first hard atherosclerotic CVD event, defined as nonfatal MI, CHD death, and fatal or nonfatal stroke. It was derived from participants in 4 community-based cohort studies sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The tool accounts for various CVD outcomes, in contrast to many earlier tools that report only CHD outcomes. In addition, the cohorts from which it was derived allowed for the development of sex- and race-specific equations.<br><br>The USPSTF focused its review of the evidence on studies of the primary prevention of CVD. It considered 11 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation15\">15-25</a> Four of these studies were published since the last USPSTF review in 2009.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation15\">15-17</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation25\">25</a> The trials had a total of 118,445 participants; 3 were conducted exclusively in men and 1 exclusively in women. Participants&rsquo; mean ages ranged from 55 to 65 years. Eight trials used an aspirin dose of 100 mg or less daily. Duration of follow-up was between 3 and 10 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation22\">22<br><br></a>Primary prevention trials consistently demonstrated effectiveness of aspirin in preventing nonfatal MI and stroke. Pooled analysis of 8 trials of low-dose aspirin (&le;100 mg daily) showed a 17% reduction in nonfatal MI and coronary events (relative risk [RR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.94]). Pooled analysis of 10 trials using any aspirin dose showed a 22% reduction.<br><br>Nonfatal strokes were also reduced when only low-dose aspirin trials were included in the analysis (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.76 to 0.98]). Few fatal stroke events were reported in trials. Pooling the 11 trials showed a nonsignificant reduction in CVD mortality (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.86 to 1.03]); results were similar when analysis was restricted to studies of low-dose aspirin.<br><br>Reduction in all-cause mortality was not significant in any of the trials reporting it. However, when trial results were pooled, all-cause mortality risk was reduced by 5% in participants taking low-dose aspirin (RR, 0.95 [CI, 0.89 to 1.01]). When trials using any aspirin dose were considered, the reduction was statistically significant (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.89 to 0.99]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation14\">14<br><br></a>Subpopulation analyses evaluated effect modification of aspirin by age, sex, and diabetes status. Analysis supports the likelihood that older age groups have greater MI benefit than younger age groups; however, results were mixed. Evidence was not sufficient to support any sex-specific differences in CVD outcomes.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation14\">14</a> This differs from the 2009 analysis, in which sex-specific outcome differences were apparent. This was likely due to the predominance of findings from the Women&rsquo;s Health Study, with its relatively young and healthy study population. There were also no clear differences in outcomes based on diabetes status.<br><br>There is evidence of a potential long-term benefit on CRC mortality. Pooled data from primary and secondary CVD prevention trials with more than 10 years of follow-up suggest that a reduction in long-term cumulative CRC mortality is possible with aspirin use. The mortality benefit did not become apparent until 10 to 20 years after randomization.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation3\">3</a> Aspirin dose in these trials ranged from 75 to 1200 mg per day, without clear evidence of a dose-related effect. The USPSTF evaluated 3 applicable primary and secondary CVD prevention trials that reported a 40% reduction in CRC incidence with aspirin use (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.47 to 0.76]) 10 to 19 years after initiation.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation22\">22</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation26\">26-28</a> These studies suggest that at least 5 to 10 years of aspirin use is required to achieve this reduction. A previously published individual-patient data meta-analysis of 4 primary and secondary CVD prevention trials showed a similar but smaller reduction in CRC incidence (hazard ratio, 0.76 [CI, 0.63 to 0.94]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation29\">29<br><br></a>Although evidence of aspirin&rsquo;s effect on other types of cancer is evolving, it has not yet been seen in trial results. Total cancer mortality was not significantly reduced across 10 RCTs of primary CVD prevention.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4\">4</a> An analysis of 6 RCTs of primary CVD prevention also showed no reduction in total cancer incidence. Other published reports have demonstrated reductions in total cancer mortality and incidence, but the RCTs included in the analyses differed from those reviewed by the USPSTF (for example, different groupings of studies, not a CVD primary prevention population, or higher doses of aspirin used).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4\">4</a>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\nUsing aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD variably increases risk for major GI and intracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, depending on the patient&rsquo;s medical history and other factors, such as concurrent medication use.The USPSTF found only 1 risk prediction tool for bleeding, based on a systematic review of risk estimates and incidence of upper GI bleeding and CHD with low-dose aspirin use.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation30\">30</a> The tool presumes a baseline incidence rate of upper GI complications of 1 event per 1000 person-years and is modified for 10-year age ranges starting at age 50 years. The tool uses Framingham sex-specific risk prediction equations for CHD and modifies bleeding risk with use of proton-pump inhibitors or <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> eradication, neither of which has been tested for net benefit as part of a comprehensive prevention regimen. Two retrospective validation studies were conducted, but data were insufficient to support its use for prospective prediction in a clinical setting.<br><br>To evaluate the risk for GI bleeding, the most common serious harm of aspirin use, the USPSTF considered 7 of the CVD primary prevention trials previously discussed.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation15\">15</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation17\">17-19</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation21\">21-23</a> These trials reported major GI bleeding events, defined as GI bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death. Aspirin dose ranged from 50 to 325 mg in all but 1 trial. Duration of use and follow-up ranged from 4 to 10 years. Major GI bleeding increased by 58% in aspirin users (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 [CI, 1.29 to 1.95]). Analyses of trials using the range of aspirin doses showed similar results. When all major primary and secondary CVD prevention trials were pooled (15 studies), the OR increased further to 1.65.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4\">4</a> Cohort studies reported similar bleeding risk with aspirin use.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation10\">10<br><br></a>Hemorrhagic stroke was a rare event; 15.5% of total strokes reported in the trials were hemorrhagic. Across 9 primary CVD prevention trials, the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 2.54 strokes per 1000 person-years in aspirin users and 1.95 strokes per 1000 person-years in nonusers. Pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin trials showed an increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 1.27 [CI, 0.96 to 1.68]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5\">5</a> Pooled analyses of 9 trials of any dose showed a significant 33% increase in hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 1.33 [CI, 1.03 to 1.71]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5\">5<br><br></a>Increased harms may result from factors that either increase bleeding risk or enhance the bleeding effect of aspirin. An adjusted individual-patient data meta-analysis found that older age (per decade), male sex, and diabetes increased risk for serious bleeding.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation31\">31</a> Smoking and increased blood pressure were also associated with increased major extracranial bleeding. A large cohort study of rates of hospitalization for major bleeding events also suggested that older age, male sex, and diabetes had effects on increasing bleeding risk. Statin and proton-pump inhibitor use may decrease the likelihood of hospitalization from a major bleeding event.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation10\">10</a>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF used a microsimulation model to estimate the magnitude of net benefit.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8\">8</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation12\">12</a> The model incorporated findings from the 3 systematic reviews to inform its parameters and assumptions. Results were stratified by age decade, sex, and 10-year CVD risk. When combined with primary trial data and meta-analyses, the model provides an additional analytic basis to assess the balance of benefits and harms of aspirin use. In addition to the numbers of nonfatal MIs and ischemic strokes prevented, CRC cases prevented, and serious GI bleeding events caused by aspirin, the USPSTF also considered net life-years and net QALYs gained (or lost) over a lifetime as a result of aspirin use (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2\">Table 2</a>).<br><br>Initiating aspirin use during ages 50 to 59 years and continuing unless contraindicated by an adverse bleeding event results in the greatest gain in net life-years (range, 219 to 463 life-years in women and 333 to 605 life-years in men) and net QALYs (range, 621 to 833 QALYs in women and 588 to 834 QALYs in men). Initiating aspirin use during ages 60 to 69 years and continuing unless contraindicated by an adverse bleeding event results in smaller gains in net life-years (range, &minus;12 to 48 life-years in women and &minus;20 to 116 life-years in men) and net QALYs (range, 284 to 360 QALYs in women and 180 to 318 QALYs in men). The USPSTF chose the 10% 10-year CVD risk threshold as the point at which the tradeoff of benefits and harms reaches an adequate level of certainty. The benefits for an individual patient may shift above or below the threshold depending on individual risk assessment.<br><br>The USPSTF determined with moderate certainty that the net benefit in life-years and QALYs gained from aspirin use is moderate in adults aged 50 to 59 years. Adults aged 60 to 69 years gain fewer net life-years and QALYs because of the increased harms from bleeding that come with older age and the reduced potential for CRC benefits (that is, direct reduction in incidence and indirect reduction in mortality), which require at least 10 years to become apparent. The USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that the net benefit from aspirin use is small in adults aged 60 to 69 years. In both age groups, persons with higher CVD risk will have a greater net benefit (provided their bleeding risk is not also increased).\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nAspirin is an NSAID. It is one of the most commonly used drugs and is used mostly to relieve pain. Over the past 30 years, its platelet and clotting effects have become better understood. Its anticlotting effect is useful for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events because it can potentially decrease the accumulation of blood clots that form as the result of reduced blood flow at atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reducing hypoxic damage to heart and brain tissue.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation32\">32<br><br></a>Aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. The COX-1 enzyme is responsible for producing the prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa. Inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme leaves the mucosa susceptible to damage and GI bleeding. This negative effect increases at higher doses of aspirin.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation33\">33<br><br></a>The mechanisms for inhibition of adenoma or CRC development are not yet well-understood. Cyclooxygenase-dependent and -independent pathways have been proposed. Cyclooxygenase-dependent pathways may rely on aspirin&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory properties to reduce tumorigenesis.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation3\">3</a>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 15 September 2015 to 12 October 2015. Many comments requested clarification about initiating and continuing aspirin use, especially for persons in their 60s and 70s. The USPSTF added language throughout the recommendation statement to clarify its focus on initiating aspirin use and enhanced the Implementation section to provide guidance on continuing aspirin use. Several comments asked for clarification on the use of aspirin to prevent CRC in persons who are not at increased CVD risk. The USPSTF clarified that its recommendation is based on the combined benefit of CVD and CRC reduction, and only at 10-year CVD risk levels of 10% or greater is there certainty that the benefits exceed the harms of low-dose aspirin use. Several comments found the tables difficult to interpret or asked to include additional age and risk levels. The USPSTF considered other presentations of the data, but the tables represent the results from the decision-analysis model that are most relevant to its estimation of net benefits. Therefore, the tables only include the age and sex ranges for which the USPSTF found moderate certainty of small or moderate net benefit. More detailed tables can be found in the decision analysis report.8<br><br>\r\n<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\nThe decision to start or continue taking aspirin to prevent CVD and CRC is complex, with many important factors for clinicians and patients to consider. The most favorable balance of benefits and harms involves benefit for both CVD and CRC prevention and little potential for harm from bleeding. Persons who either are at low risk for CVD events or have a life expectancy too short to benefit from a reduced risk for CRC will receive significantly less benefit; thus, the balance of benefits and harms will likely not be favorable.The balance of benefits and harms of aspirin use is contingent on 4 main factors: risk for bleeding, preferences about taking aspirin, baseline CVD risk, and age.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Risk for bleeding:</em>&nbsp;Aspirin use is likely to do more harm than good in persons who are at increased risk for GI or intracranial bleeding.</li>\r\n<li><em>Preferences about taking aspirin:</em>&nbsp;Persons who place a high value on avoiding long-term daily medication use are poor candidates for aspirin use.</li>\r\n<li><em>Baseline CVD risk:</em>&nbsp;A CVD risk threshold of 10% should prompt a discussion about aspirin use. Persons who are at higher risk will benefit more from aspirin use than those who are near the 10% threshold. Although persons who are at lower risk may still receive benefit, they are less likely to have a favorable balance of benefits and harms.</li>\r\n<li><em>Age 50 to 59 years:</em>&nbsp;Initiating aspirin in this age group has the largest average net benefit (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1\">Table 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2\">Table 2</a>). A CVD risk threshold of 10% will identify patients for whom the benefits outweigh the harms, provided they are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take long-term daily medication. In addition, persons in this age range generally have sufficient life expectancy to benefit from a reduced risk for CRC.</li>\r\n<li><em>Age 60 to 69 years:</em>&nbsp;Adults in this age group with a higher CVD risk are most likely to have a favorable balance of benefits and harms, and younger adults are more likely to benefit from a reduced risk for CRC. Adults aged 60 to 69 years who are already taking aspirin as recommended by their clinician should continue use unless they develop new risk factors for bleeding. Adults who develop CVD should use aspirin, as directed by their clinician, to prevent future CVD events.</li>\r\n<li><em>Age 70 years or older:</em>&nbsp;The USPSTF was unable to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in this age group. Adults aged 70 years or older who are currently taking aspirin should discuss with their clinician whether they should continue.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe time to benefit for CRC (that is, reduced CRC incidence and death) and time to harm are important considerations in assessing the benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in older adults. The CVD prevention benefit begins within the first 5 years of use and continues as long as aspirin is used. The CRC prevention benefit is more complex. It takes at least 5 to 10 years of daily aspirin use to obtain a CRC benefit; however, due to a longer latent period, the benefit may take 10 to 20 years to appear. Therefore, older adults and those with shorter remaining life expectancy may receive less benefit. Meanwhile, bleeding harms may occur in the short term.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1\">Table 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2\">Table 2</a>provide information to help clinicians understand the balance of benefits and harms of aspirin therapy, especially for adults in their 60s. The magnitude of net benefit is smaller at lower 10-year CVD risk levels and greater at higher levels. For both men and women, CRC benefits tend to be lower at higher CVD risk levels due to competing causes of mortality, including death from CVD.\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nThere are many important research gaps that, if filled, could identify populations that may benefit the most from using aspirin to prevent CVD and CRC. Cardiovascular disease prevention in subpopulations is a significant evidence gap. No data exist on the role of aspirin therapy in racial/ethnic groups. Additional evidence on benefits and harms in persons younger than 50 years or 70 years or older would help clarify who could potentially benefit from aspirin use. An updated version of the individual-patient data meta-analysis from the Antithrombotic Trialists&rsquo; Collaboration that accounts for confounders would be helpful in understanding the effect of aspirin in subpopulations.<br><br>More information is needed to determine the interactions between statins and aspirin. How the use of proton-pump inhibitors with aspirin may change the balance of benefits and harms should be better understood. In addition, more information is needed to differentiate between aspirin&rsquo;s effect in reducing risk for ischemic stroke and increasing risk for hemorrhagic stroke.<br><br>The effect of aspirin use on CRC prevention in subpopulations is also an important research gap. The differential effects of sex, race/ethnicity, age, and genetic factors on risk for CRC and the effect of screening require additional research. More research is also needed to determine the best dosing strategies, the long-term effects in persons with previous adenoma and on adenoma prevention, and the durability of benefits after aspirin is discontinued. Longer-term follow-up of CVD prevention trials that report cancer incidence and mortality outcomes would be helpful.<br><br>Additional research is needed to better estimate the harms of aspirin-induced GI bleeding. Development of an externally validated risk assessment tool for bleeding that could be used at the point of care would be helpful. A tool that considers both CVD risk and GI bleeding risk would be useful to clinicians and patients when deciding whether to start or continue aspirin use for primary prevention.",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>About 14% of US adults aged 40 to 79 years have COPD, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a>Persons with severe COPD are often unable to participate in normal physical activity due to deterioration of lung function.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is defined as airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to harmful particles or gases. Diagnosis is based on postbronchodilator spirometry, which detects fixed airway obstruction; a forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio of less than 0.70 is the current criterion for a positive COPD diagnosis. Persons with COPD often, but not always, have symptoms such as dyspnea (difficulty breathing or shortness of breath), chronic cough, and chronic sputum production. Patients often have a history of exposure to risk factors such as cigarette smoke or heating fuels or occupational exposure to dusts or chemicals. Although postbronchodilator spirometry is required to make a definitive diagnosis, prescreening questionnaires can elicit current symptoms and previous exposures to harmful particles or gases.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons using questionnaires or spirometry improves health outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening. However, given the lack of benefit of early detection and treatment, the opportunity cost associated with screening asymptomatic persons may be large. The amount of time and effort required to screen for COPD in asymptomatic persons (using screening spirometry with or without prescreening questionnaires) is not trivial.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF determined that early detection of COPD, before the development of symptoms, does not alter the course of the disease or improve patient outcomes. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons has no net benefit. &nbsp;Thus, screening is not recommended in persons who do not have symptoms suggestive of COPD.&nbsp; The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\nThis recommendation statement applies to asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms. It does not apply to at-risk persons who present to clinicians with symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnea, or wheezing. It also does not apply to persons with a family history of &alpha;1-antitrypsin deficiency.\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\nExposure to cigarette smoke or toxic fumes increases the risk for COPD. Epidemiological studies have found that 15% to 50% of smokers develop COPD.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a> More than 70% of all COPD cases occur in current or former smokers. Occupational exposure to toxins, dusts, or industrial chemicals contributes an estimated 15% of all COPD cases. Environmental pollution, including wood smoke and traffic pollutants, is also associated with increased risk for COPD. Nonmodifiable risk factors for COPD include history of asthma or childhood respiratory tract infections and &alpha;1-antitrypsin deficiency.\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nScreening adults in primary care involves either risk assessment via a formal prescreening questionnaire and, if positive, follow-up with diagnostic spirometry testing or screening spirometry administered without a bronchodilator and, if positive, follow-up with diagnostic spirometry testing. Patients identified as high risk by a prescreening questionnaire or screening spirometry are referred for diagnostic spirometry testing. Diagnosis by spirometry requires persistent airway obstruction after administration of an inhaled bronchodilator, such as albuterol (ie, postbronchodilator spirometry). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is diagnosed when the patient has a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.70. Severity is defined by the percentage of predicted postbronchodilator FEV1; 80% or more is mild, 50% to 79% is moderate, 30% to 49% is severe, and less than 30% is very severe.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nPrevention of exposure to cigarette smoke and other toxic fumes is the best way to prevent COPD.&nbsp; Interventions to prevent the initiation of tobacco use are an effective way to prevent exposure to cigarette smoke. Current smokers should receive smoking cessation counseling and be offered behavioral and pharmacological therapies to stop smoking.\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults, including pregnant women, about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. The USPSTF also recommends that clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents.

The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to examine whether screening for COPD improves the delivery and uptake of targeted preventive services, such as smoking cessation or relevant immunizations. In addition to the potential benefits of screening, the USPSTF also examined the possible harms of screening for and treatment of mild to moderate COPD. The diagnostic accuracy of screening tools (including prescreening questionnaires and spirometry) was not part of the previous systematic review but was evaluated in the current review.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation6\">6</a>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Prescreening and Screening Tests</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF identified 3 externally validated questionnaires based on risk factors, symptoms, or both: the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation7\">7</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation8\">8</a> the Lung Function Questionnaire,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation9\">9</a> and the COPD Population Screener.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation10\">10</a> In addition, 3 other questionnaires are currently in development but have not yet been externally validated.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a> The COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire is an 8-item questionnaire; using a cutoff of greater than 16.5, it has a sensitivity of about 90% and specificity of about 40% for identifying persons with COPD in a primary care population.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a> The Lung Function Questionnaire is a 5-item questionnaire; using a cutoff of 18 or greater, it has a sensitivity of approximately 88% and specificity of approximately 25% in a primary care population of current and former smokers.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a> The COPD Population Screener is a 5-item questionnaire; using a cutoff of 4 or greater, it has a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 73% in a general population in Japan.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3<br><br></a>The USPSTF found 2 heterogeneous international studies of screening with handheld peak flow meters that were not considered applicable to a US primary care population.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a> Screening with pulmonary function tests (without bronchodilators) was studied in primary care populations in Australia and Sweden<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a> and yielded sensitivity of about 50% and specificity of 90% for a cutoff of less than 0.70. Another screening study conducted in Greece evaluated postbronchodilator spirometry and yielded sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95% for the same cutoff.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a> The USPSTF found no pulmonary function screening studies conducted in the United States.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF found no studies that directly assessed the effects of screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults on morbidity, mortality, or health-related quality of life. The USPSTF also found no studies that examined the effectiveness of screening on relevant immunization rates. The USPSTF identified 5 studies that assessed the effects of screening on smoking cessation.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation11\">11-15</a> These studies primarily examined the incremental value of adding spirometry testing to existing smoking cessation programs. One trial showed a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation rates between participants who received explanations of their spirometry results using &ldquo;lung age&rdquo; and those who did not.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation11\">11</a> The other 4 trials did not report any significant differences in smoking abstinence rates.<br><br>The USPSTF examined the treatment efficacy of 4 classes of medications used to treat COPD: long-acting &beta;-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting anticholinergics (tiotropium), and combination therapy with corticosteroids and LABAs.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3</a>No treatment trials were conducted in asymptomatic or screen-detected populations; all were conducted in populations with moderate COPD. Two studies of LABAs found no difference in all-cause mortality but found decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms in the treatment vs control group in post hoc subanalysis. Decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms was reported for patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COPD. However, rates of COPD exacerbation were extremely low at baseline (&lt;1 episode per year), even among participants reporting symptoms. Six trials of inhaled corticosteroids found decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms but no difference in all-cause mortality, dyspnea, or quality of life. One trial of combination therapy with corticosteroids and LABAs found decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms but no differences in mortality or quality of life. Five trials of anticholinergics found decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms but insufficient evidence on other outcomes. For all classes of medications, the one consistent finding was that treatment decreases exacerbation of COPD symptoms in persons with moderate COPD but has no consistent effects on all-cause mortality, dyspnea, or quality of life. There was insufficient evidence on the effects of treatment on exercise capacity and functional status.\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe potential harms of using prescreening questionnaires and screening spirometry are false-positive and false-negative results. The USPSTF found no evidence to estimate the short- or long-term harms of these screening tests. Potential harms of treatment include pneumonia with use of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids and decreased bone density and increased fractures with use of inhaled corticosteroids. However, data were sparse, with few adverse events, and there were no differences between the intervention and control groups.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3\">3<br><br></a>Because all of the treatment trials were conducted in persons with mild to moderate COPD, it is unclear how these results would apply to asymptomatic populations. The potential treatment benefit of decreased exacerbation of symptoms may not apply to patients who report no symptoms to begin with. Given the lack of potential benefits of treatment in asymptomatic persons and the not-trivial work of screening, the USPSTF determined that there is no net benefit of screening.\r\n<h3>How Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\nTo date, treatment trials of COPD have found modest treatment benefits in patients with mild to moderate COPD. Because the majority of COPD cases result from exposure to cigarette smoke and other toxic fumes, the most effective way to prevent COPD is to limit such exposure. Persons with a history of exposure and symptoms such as dyspnea, chronic cough, or sputum production should be evaluated for the diagnosis of COPD.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 18 to September 14, 2015. The USPSTF received requests for clarification about whether high-risk groups, such as current smokers, were included in the systematic review. In response, the USPSTF clarified that both current and former smokers were included in the studies reviewed. However, the lack of stratified results by smoking status limits the USPSTF&rsquo;s ability to make a separate recommendation for screening in persons who are at higher risk for COPD. The USPSTF recognizes that patients who have mild COPD may underreport symptoms. The USPSTF encourages clinicians to offer smoking cessation interventions to all patients who currently smoke and to pursue active case-finding for COPD in patients with risk factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke or heating fuels, occupational exposure to dusts or chemicals, or a family history of &alpha;1-antitrypsin deficiency.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3><br>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF reviewed studies whose participants included former and current smokers, but many studies, including those that examined the accuracy of screening tools, did not report results separately by smoking status (ie, current vs former smokers). Future studies that stratify risk by smoking status could help identify different risk groups that may benefit from screening. In addition, trials are needed that assess the effects of screening among current and previous smokers in primary care on long-term health outcomes. Long-term trials of treatment of COPD in screen-detected patients are also needed. Better treatment options for COPD and long-term epidemiological studies of the natural history and heterogeneity of COPD progression could also help identify patients who are at greatest risk for clinical deterioration.",

Additional risk factors for cataracts are smoking, alcohol use, ultraviolet light exposure, diabetes, corticosteroid use, and black race. Risk factors for AMD include smoking, family history, and white race.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nThe harms of screening in a primary care setting have not been adequately studied. Overall, the potential for harms from treatment are small to none. Harms of treatment of refractive error include a potential for increased falls with the use of multifocal lenses; infectious keratitis with the use of contact lenses, laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), or laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK); and corneal ectasia with LASIK. Harms of cataract surgery include posterior lens opacification and endophthalmitis. Treatment of AMD with antioxidant vitamins and mineral supplements is not associated with increased risk of most serious adverse events.<br><br>Although there appears to be benefit in longer-term outcomes, a systematic review found that treatment of AMD with laser photocoagulation was associated with greater risk of acute loss of 6 or more lines of visual acuity vs no treatment at 3 months (relative risk [RR], 1.41 [95% CI, 1.08&ndash;1.82]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation3\">3</a> Pooled estimates report a non&ndash;statistically significant association bewteen photodynamic therapy and risk of acute loss of 20 or more letters of visual acuity vs placebo at 7 days (RR, 3.75 [95% CI, 0.87&ndash;16]) (3 trials).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation5\">5</a> One of 2 trials found that treatment of wet AMD with intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapy was associated with greater likelihood of withdrawal vs sham therapy; there were no differences in serious or other adverse events, but estimates were imprecise.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation6\">6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation7\">7</a>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nAbout half of US adults older than 65 years reported having an eye examination within the last 12 months in a 2007 study.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation8\">8</a>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nA visual acuity test (eg, the Snellen eye chart) is the usual method for screening for visual acuity impairment in the primary care setting. Screening questions are not as accurate as visual acuity testing for identifying visual acuity impairment. Evidence on the use of other tests for vision screening in primary care, such as the pinhole test (a test for refractive error), the Amsler grid (a test of central vision to detect AMD), genetic testing, or funduscopy (visual inspection of the interior of the eye), is lacking.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nSeveral types of treatment are effective for improving visual acuity. Corrective lenses improve visual acuity in patients with a refractive error. Treatment of cataracts through surgical removal of the cataract is effective for improving visual acuity. Treatment of exudative (or wet) AMD includes laser photocoagulation, verteporfin, and intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors. Antioxidant vitamins and minerals are an effective treatment for dry AMD.\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\nThis recommendation statement does not include screening for glaucoma.

Older adults have a higher prevalence of primary ocular disease and systemic diseases associated with ocular disease than younger adults; in addition, older adults also have normal age-related changes in vision (ie, presbyopia). In 2011, an estimated 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older reported vision loss.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1<br><br></a>Refractive error, AMD, and cataracts are common causes of vision impairment in older adults. Severe refractive error (requiring correction of &ge;+3.0 diopters) affects an estimated 6% of US adults aged 50 to 54 years, 15% of adults aged 65 to 69 years, and 20% of adults 80 years or older.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a> About 60% of all cases of refractive error are deemed correctable to better than 20/40 visual acuity.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation9\">9</a> In the United States, more than 15 million adults older than 65 years have cataracts, and it is the most common cause of blindness in black adults older than 40 years. Age-related macular degeneration affects 1.5 million older adults in the United States and is the most common cause of blindness in white adults.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation2\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation10\">10</a>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\nIn 2009, the USPSTF issued an I statement on screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults. To update this I statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to focus on evidence published since its last review. The USPSTF reviewed evidence on screening for visual acuity impairment associated with uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and AMD in adults 65 years or older in the primary care setting. The USPSTF also reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, the accuracy of screening, and the benefits and harms of treatment of early vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and AMD.\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\nAsking screening questions to elicit self-perceived problems with vision has been studied as a screening method. However, compared with a standard eye chart, screening questions are not accurate for identifying persons with vision impairment.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4<br><br></a>In the United States, a standardized visual acuity test is the usual method for identifying the presence of vision impairment. Visual acuity tests assess the patient&rsquo;s ability to recognize letters of different sizes arranged in rows from a prespecified distance (typically 20 feet). Standardized visual acuity tests are good at identifying refractive error.<br><br>Compared with a detailed ophthalmological examination, no visual acuity screening test has both high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of any underlying visual condition (eg, AMD or cataracts). Few studies have focused on the accuracy of the Amsler grid, clinical examination, pinhole test, or fundus examination in the primary care setting. One study on the Amsler grid reported poor accuracy for detecting any visual condition compared with ophthalmological examination, and 1 study reported that geriatricians correctly identified most patients with cataracts and AMD through a clinical examination.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4<br><br></a>Two studies from 2012 evaluated the accuracy of the Computer Vision Screen and its flip-chart version compared with a &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; eye examination that included detailed history, symptoms, and a comprehensive eye examination. These studies reported moderate sensitivity (0.75 to 0.80) and specificity (0.68 to 0.77).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation11\">11</a> A third study from 2009 evaluated the accuracy of the Minimum Data Set 2.0 Vision Patterns section compared with a standard visual acuity test. The study reported poor accuracy, depending on the cutoff score; sensitivity ranged from 0.11 to 0.52 and specificity ranged from 0.25 to 0.96.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation12\">12</a>These studies had methodological limitations, including uncertainty as to whether the reference standard was interpreted independently from the screening test and the lack of a predefined threshold to determine a positive result.\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\nThere is limited direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for visual impairment in the primary care setting. Three fair-quality cluster randomized clinical trials (RCTs) found no difference in vision and other clinical or functional outcomes between vision screening (as part of a multicomponent screening) with visual acuity testing or questions compared with usual care, no vision screening, or delayed screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation13\">13-15</a> The application of this evidence to screening in a primary care setting has limitations. Issues with the study methods include failure to report allocation concealment, lack of intention-to-treat analysis, and unclear blinding of outcome assessors. Other limitations relevant to the primary care setting include that the recommended interventions are provided by eye care specialists and that many patients do not get the recommended glasses.<br><br>Consistent evidence shows that most older adults with a refractive error can achieve visual acuity better than 20/40 with refractive correction. Evidence from a few trials indicates that immediate correction of refractive error with eyeglasses in older adults is associated with improved short-term vision-related quality of life or function compared with delayed treatment. A 2005 systematic review of 179 RCTs and observational studies found that refractive surgery was highly effective at improving refractive error; 92% to 94% of persons with myopia and 86% to 96% of persons with hyperopia achieved visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, most of these studies were done in younger adults, limiting its generalizability to older adults.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation16\">16<br><br></a>Cataract surgery is consistently associated with improved visual acuity in observational studies. About 90% of patients have postoperative visual acuity better than 20/40.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation17\">17</a> The effects of cataract surgery on vision-related quality of life and function are mixed. One trial reported a decreased risk of falls after immediate vs delayed cataract surgery (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.40&ndash;0.96]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation18\">18</a> Another trial reported no effect on falls or fracture risk.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation19\">19</a> Some studies showed improvements in measures of function and quality of life associated with cataract surgery, while others reported no effect on these measures. Evidence from observational studies on the effects of treatment on motor vehicle accidents and death is sparse and inconclusive. No randomized trials were identified that evaluated clinical outcomes associated with cataract surgery vs no surgery.<br><br>A systematic review from 2006 reported that antioxidants were effective for slowing the progression of dry AMD; its conclusions were primarily based on 1 large good-quality trial (the Age-Related Eye Disease Study).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation20\">20</a> It found that taking an antioxidant multivitamin (composed of vitamins C and E and beta-carotene with zinc) was associated with reduced likelihood of progression to advanced AMD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.68); however, the between-group differences in the likelihood of losing measurable visual acuity did not reach statistical significance. A 10-year follow-up study of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study published in 2009 reported similar results; an antioxidant multivitamin with zinc was associated with reduced likelihood of progression of AMD (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.83]). The likelihood of losing measurable visual acuity did reach statistical significance in this follow-up study (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.88]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation21\">21<br><br></a>For wet AMD, laser photocoagulation is superior to no treatment in slowing the progression of vision loss (&ge;6 lines of visual acuity) after 2 years (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.83]), although these studies had important limitations.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation3\">3</a> Two good-quality systematic reviews of photodynamic therapy found verteporfin, a photoreactive agent, to be superior to placebo in preventing loss of visual acuity associated with wet AMD; quality-of-life outcomes were not reported.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation5\">5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation22\">22</a> Injection of VEGF inhibitors (eg, pegaptanib and ranibizumab) to suppress growth of abnormal blood vessels associated with wet AMD was effective in reducing risk of visual acuity loss (&lt;15 letters of visual acuity) (RR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22 to 1.75]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation23\">23</a> Evidence on vision-related functional outcomes is limited; 1 trial reported small improvements in vision-related functional scores in the treatment group, and 1 trial reported a higher likelihood of driving in the treatment group.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\nNo studies are available on the harms of screening in a primary care setting. Several studies evaluated the harms of treatment of refractive error, cataracts, and AMD. Most of these studies are older and were reviewed for the 2009 USPSTF recommendation. Data on harms of treatment of refractive error in older adults are limited. A small observational study reported an association between multifocal lens use and increased risk of falls in older adults.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation24\">24</a> Serious harms, including vision loss, are rare as a result of contact lens use or refractive surgery. Corneal ectasia, a thinning and bulging of the cornea, is a known harm of refractive surgery and occurs at a median rate of 0.2%.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a> Cataract surgery can lead to posterior capsule opacification of the implanted lens, requiring further procedures; reported rates of this complication vary widely from 0.7% to 48%.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation17\">17</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation25\">25</a> A systematic review from 1998 reported an incidence of 28% at 5 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation26\">26</a> Endophthalmitis, bullous keratopathy, dislocation of intraocular lens, macular edema, and retinal detachment are other complications associated with cataract surgery.<br><br>Pooled data on the harms of treatment of AMD from trials of antioxidant vitamins and minerals reported no association with withdrawal due to gastrointestinal symptoms.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a> The largest trial reported an increased risk of hospitalization due to genitourinary causes with zinc and an increased risk of yellowing skin with antioxidants; it found no association with death or lung cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a> Two trials on the treatment of early AMD reported no association between supplement use and any adverse event, serious adverse events, serious ocular events, or withdrawal due to adverse events.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1<br><br></a>Treatment of wet AMD with laser photocoagulation is associated with increased risk of acute visual acuity loss at 3 months after the procedure but, as described earlier, is also associated with reduced risk of visual acuity loss at 2 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a> Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin carries an initial risk of acute visual acuity loss and greater risk of back pain related to the infusion.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation5\">5</a> Other reported harms of photodynamic therapy include visual disturbance, injection site reactions, and photosensitivity. Potential harms associated with intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors include endophthalmitis, uveitis, increased intraocular pressure, traumatic lens injury, and retinal detachment.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a> In 3 trials, these outcomes were infrequent, and differences between the intervention and sham therapy groups were not statistically significant; however, estimates were imprecise, with wide CIs given the rarity of these outcomes.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation6\">6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation7\">7</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation27\">27</a>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\nThe limited direct evidence from 3 fair-quality cluster RCTs show no difference in vision and other clinical or functional outcomes between vision screening and usual care, no vision screening, or delayed screening.<br><br>Although visual acuity testing is adequate for identifying refractive error, it is inadequate for identifying early AMD or early cataracts in a primary care setting. Effective treatments are available for uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and AMD. The overall harms are small; however, many of the treatments carry a small risk of serious complications, including acute visual loss. Although treatments that entail little harm can correct impaired visual acuity, limited evidence is available on the effect of screening and treatment on quality of life and overall and vision-related function, especially in older adults with screen-detected visual problems.<br><br>The limitations of the direct evidence and the inadequacy of the evidence on key pieces of indirect evidence prevent the USPSTF from developing a coherent assessment of the overall net benefit; therefore, the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 21 through August 17, 2015. The USPSTF received very few comments on the draft recommendation statement. One respondent requested that the USPSTF clarify that an I statement is not a recommendation against screening; the USPSTF plans to reinforce when communicating this recommendation statement that an I statement is not a recommendation for or against screening.<br><br>\r\n<h3>Other Considerations<br><br>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\nMore evidence is needed on accurate methods of screening in a primary care setting to identify disorders that do not manifest themselves through loss of visual acuity. More studies are needed that evaluate the link between vision screening in older adults and improved function, quality of life, and independence. Further studies are needed on the association between use of corrective lenses and risk of falls, including possible associations with changes in lens prescriptions and the use of multifocal glasses.",

In 2016, an estimated 134,000 persons will be diagnosed with the disease, and about 49,000 will die from it. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among adults aged 65 to 74 years; the median age at death from colorectal cancer is 68 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a></p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer with several different methods can accurately detect early-stage colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps.<br><br>Although single test performance is an important issue in the detection of colorectal cancer, the sensitivity of the test over time is more important in an ongoing screening program. However, data that permit assessment and direct comparison of screening methods to detect colorectal neoplasia in screening programs over time are limited to those from analytic modeling.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Screening and Early Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years reduces colorectal cancer mortality. The USPSTF found no head-to-head studies demonstrating that any of the screening strategies it considered are more effective than others, although the tests have varying levels of evidence supporting their effectiveness, as well as different strengths and limitations (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#tab\">Table</a>). About one-third of eligible adults in the United States have never been screened for colorectal cancer,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;and offering choice in colorectal cancer screening strategies may increase screening uptake.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation5\">5</a>&nbsp;As such, the screening tests are not presented in any preferred or ranked order; rather, the goal is to maximize the total number of persons who are screened because that will have the largest effect on reducing colorectal cancer deaths.<br><br>The benefit of early detection of and intervention for colorectal cancer declines after age 75 years. Among older adults who have been previously screened for colorectal cancer, there is at best a moderate benefit to continuing screening during the ages of 76 to 85 years. However, adults in this age group who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit than those who have been previously screened.<br><br>The time between detection and treatment of colorectal cancer and realization of a subsequent mortality benefit can be substantial. As such, the benefit of early detection of and intervention for colorectal cancer in adults 86 years and older is at most small.<br><br>To date, no method of screening for colorectal cancer has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in any age group.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation6\">6</a></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Early Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years are small. The majority of harms result from the use of colonoscopy, either as the screening test or as follow-up for positive findings detected by other screening tests. The rate of serious adverse events from colorectal cancer screening increases with age.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Thus, the harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 years and older are small to moderate.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit (ie, the benefit minus the harms) of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years is substantial.<br><br>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened is small.

The USPSTF did not review or consider the evidence on the effectiveness of any particular surveillance regimen after diagnosis and removal of adenomatous polyps or colorectal cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>For the vast majority of adults, the most important risk factor for colorectal cancer is older age. Most cases of colorectal cancer occur among adults older than 50 years; the median age at diagnosis is 68 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a><br><br>A positive family history (excluding known inherited familial syndromes) is thought to be linked to about 20% of cases of colorectal cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;About 3% to 10% of the population has a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF did not specifically review the evidence on screening in populations at increased risk; however, other professional organizations recommend that patients with a family history of colorectal cancer (a first-degree relative with early-onset colorectal cancer or multiple first-degree relatives with the disease) be screened more frequently starting at a younger age, and with colonoscopy.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation8\">8</a><br><br>Male sex and black race are also associated with higher colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.

Multitargeted stool DNA testing has increased single-test sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer compared with FIT alone.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;The harms of stool-based testing primarily result from adverse events associated with follow-up colonoscopy of positive findings.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;The specificity of FIT-DNA is lower than that of FIT alone,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;which means it has a higher number of false-positive results and higher likelihood of follow-up colonoscopy and experiencing an associated adverse event per screening test. There are no empirical data on the appropriate longitudinal follow-up for an abnormal FIT-DNA test result followed by a negative colonoscopy; there is potential for overly intensive surveillance due to clinician and patient concerns about the implications of the genetic component of the test.</p>\r\n<h4>Direct Visualization Tests</h4>\r\n<p>Several RCTs have shown that flexible sigmoidoscopy alone reduces deaths from colorectal cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with FIT has been studied in a single trial and was found to reduce the colorectal cancer&ndash;specific mortality rate more than flexible sigmoidoscopy alone.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation14\">14</a>&nbsp;Modeling studies conducted by CISNET also consistently estimate that combined testing yields more life-years gained and colorectal cancer deaths averted compared with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Flexible sigmoidoscopy can result in direct harms, such as colonic perforations and bleeding, although the associated event rates are much lower than those observed with colonoscopy.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Harms can also occur as a result of follow-up colonoscopy.<br><br>Completed trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy provide indirect evidence that colonoscopy&mdash;a similar endoscopic screening method&mdash;reduces colorectal cancer mortality. A prospective cohort study also found an association between patients who self-reported being screened with colonoscopy and a lower colorectal cancer mortality rate.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation15\">15</a>&nbsp;Colonoscopy has both indirect and direct harms. Harms may be caused by bowel preparation prior to the procedure (eg, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances), the sedation used during the procedure (eg, cardiovascular events), or the procedure itself (eg, infection, colonic perforations, or bleeding).<br><br>Evidence for assessing the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) colonography is limited to studies of its test characteristics.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>Computed tomography colonography can result in unnecessary diagnostic testing or treatment of incidental extracolonic findings that are of no importance or would never have threatened the patient&rsquo;s health or become apparent without screening (ie, overdiagnosis and overtreatment).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Extracolonic findings are common, occurring in about 40% to 70% of screening examinations. Between 5% and 37% of these findings result in diagnostic follow-up, and about 3% require definitive treatment.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;As with other screening strategies, indirect harms from CT colonography can also occur from follow-up colonoscopy for positive findings.</p>\r\n<h4>Serology Tests</h4>\r\n<p>The FDA approved a blood test to detect circulating methylated&nbsp;<em>SEPT9</em>&nbsp;DNA (Epi proColon; Epigenomics) in April 2016.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;A single test characteristic study met the inclusion criteria for the systematic evidence review supporting this recommendation statement; it found the&nbsp;<em>SEPT9&nbsp;</em>DNA test to have low sensitivity (48%) for detecting colorectal cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation17\">17</a></p>\r\n<h3>Starting and Stopping Ages</h3>\r\n<p>Available RCTs of gFOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy included patients with age ranges of 45 to 80 years and 50 to 74 years, respectively. For gFOBT, the majority of participants entered the trials at age 50 or 60 years; for flexible sigmoidoscopy, the mean age of participants was 56 to 60 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a><br><br>Microsimulation analyses performed by CISNET suggest that starting colorectal cancer screening at age 45 years rather than 50 years is estimated to yield a modest increase in life-years gained and a more efficient balance between life-years gained and lifetime number of colonoscopies (a proxy measure for the burden of screening).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;However, across the different screening methods, lowering the age at which to begin screening to 45 years while maintaining the same screening interval resulted in an estimated increase in the lifetime number of colonoscopies. In the case of screening colonoscopy, 2 of the 3 models found that by starting screening at age 45 years, the screening interval could be extended from 10 to 15 years. Doing so maintained the same (or slightly more) life-years gained as performing colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 50 years without increasing the lifetime number of colonoscopies. However, 1 model estimated a slight loss in life-years gained with a longer screening interval and an earlier age at which to begin screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a><br><br>The USPSTF considered these findings and concluded that the evidence best supports a starting age of 50 years for the general population, noting the modest increase in life-years gained by starting screening earlier, the discordant findings across models for extending the screening interval when the age at which to begin screening is lowered, and the lack of empirical evidence in younger populations.<br><br>The age at which the balance of benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening becomes less favorable varies based on a patient&rsquo;s life expectancy, health status, comorbid conditions, and prior screening status.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;Empirical data from randomized trials on outcomes of screening after age 74 years are scarce. All 3 CISNET models consistently estimate that few additional life-years are gained when screening is extended past age 75 years among average-risk adults who have previously received adequate screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a><br><br>The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults 86 years and older. In this age group, competing causes of mortality preclude a mortality benefit that would outweigh the harms.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence from RCTs demonstrates that annual or biennial screening with gFOBT as well as 1-time and every 3- to 5-year flexible sigmoidoscopy reduces colorectal cancer deaths.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;The CISNET models found that several screening strategies were estimated to yield comparable life-years gained (ie, life-years gained with the noncolonoscopy strategies were within 90% of those gained with the colonoscopy strategy) among adults aged 50 to 75 years and an efficient balance of benefits and harms (see the full CISNET report for more details<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation12\">12</a>). These screening strategies include 1) annual screening with FIT, 2) screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and annual screening with FIT, 3) screening every 10 years with colonoscopy, and 4) screening every 5 years with CT colonography. The findings for CT colonography depend on the proxy measure used for the burden of screening (number of lifetime colonoscopies or lifetime cathartic bowel preparations). Two of the 3 CISNET models found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years (as recommended by the manufacturer) was estimated to yield life-years gained less than 90% of the colonoscopy screening strategy (84% and 87%, respectively). Another way to conceptualize these findings is to note that CISNET modeling found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years was estimated to provide about the same amount of benefit as screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 years (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig\">Figure</a>).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of early-stage colorectal cancer generally consists of local excision or simple polypectomy for tumors limited to the colonic mucosa or surgical resection (via laparoscopy or open approach) with anastomosis for larger, localized lesions.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made a recommendation on aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer in average-risk adults (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",
      "other": "<h3><em><strong>Other Considerations</strong></em></h3>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Colorectal cancer causes substantial morbidity and mortality, and the evidence is convincing that screening for colorectal cancer reduces that burden. Despite the availability of several effective screening options, nearly one-third of eligible adults have never been screened.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation19\">19</a>&nbsp;Different screening methods may be more or less attractive for patients based on their features. For example, colonoscopy requires a relatively greater time commitment over a short period (bowel preparation, procedure, and recovery) but allows for much longer time between screenings compared with stool-based screening. Stool-based screening requires persons to handle their feces, which may be difficult for some, but the test is quick and noninvasive and can be done at home (the sample is mailed to the laboratory for testing). Flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with annual FIT may be an attractive option for persons who want reassurance from endoscopic screening but want to limit their exposure to colonoscopy. Given the lack of evidence from head-to-head comparative trials that any of the screening strategies have a greater net benefit than the others, clinicians should consider engaging patients in informed decision making about the screening strategy that would most likely result in completion, with high adherence over time, taking into consideration both the patient&rsquo;s preferences and local availability.For colorectal cancer screening programs to be successful in reducing mortality, they need to involve more than just the screening method in isolation. Screening is a cascade of activities that must occur in concert, cohesively, and in an organized way for benefits to be realized, from the point of the initial screening examination (including related interventions or services that are required for successful administration of the screening test, such as bowel preparation or sedation with endoscopy) to the timely receipt of any necessary diagnostic follow-up and treatment.Multiple effective implementation strategies have been demonstrated to increase appropriate provision and use of colorectal cancer screening. Specifically, the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends using clinician and patient reminder systems, using small media (such as videos, letters, and brochures), reducing structural barriers to screening (such as the time or distance to the screening delivery setting or offering extended or nonstandard clinic hours), and providing clinician assessment and feedback about screening rates (more information is available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html\">www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer</a><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer\">This link goes offsite. Click to read the external link disclaimer</a>).Lastly, clinicians also need to consider how they will engage patients older than 75 years about when to stop screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Higher-quality data are needed about the natural history of small (&lt;10 mm) adenomas to improve understanding of optimal screening and surveillance strategies and to guide when clinical intervention is necessary. Further, because determining the ultimate worth of a screening method requires an accurate assessment of the net benefit of that intervention, randomized trials are needed to directly compare different types of colorectal cancer screening programs to more clearly define their relative benefits and harms; however, the USPSTF appreciates the challenges inherent in performing such trials, given the large sample sizes and long time horizons required.A recent analysis of data from the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program suggests that the incidence of colorectal cancer may be increasing among adults younger than 50 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation20\">20</a>&nbsp;Modeling suggests there may be some potential advantages to starting colonoscopy screening at an earlier age (45 years) and to extending the interval between screenings with negative findings.Black and Alaska Native individuals have a higher incidence of and mortality rate from colorectal cancer compared with the general population. Empirical data about the effectiveness of different screening strategies for these at-risk populations are not available.Although there is a growing body of evidence on the test performance characteristics of CT colonography, evidence to bound the potential harms of this technology is still lacking, particularly in regard to incidental findings. More consistent and complete reporting, in studies with longer-term follow-up, of the downstream consequences of initial detection, subsequent workup, and definitive treatment of extracolonic findings (ie, CT Colonography Reporting and Data System findings categorized as E3&mdash;&ldquo;likely unimportant finding, incompletely characterized: subject to local practice and patient preference, workup may be indicated&rdquo; and E4&mdash;&ldquo;potentially important finding: communicate to referring physician as per accepted practice guidelines&rdquo;) would allow for better understanding of the net benefit associated with this screening approach.Empirical evidence is lacking on the appropriate follow-up of abnormal results from FIT-DNA screening when the initial diagnostic colonoscopy is negative. There is a theoretical concern that FIT-DNA may generate inappropriate use of surveillance colonoscopy if clinicians and patients place increased importance on the genetic component of the test. At present, evidence is lacking to establish the optimal frequency of screening with the FIT-DNA test. As a condition of its approval of the test, the FDA required the manufacturer to conduct a longitudinal study examining the test characteristics of a 3-year screening interval; these data should help inform decisions.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation21\">21</a>Studies on patient adherence to the various screening options, within single-method screening programs over time, as well as factors that may influence adherence across different screening methods, are needed to help better inform and improve uptake of screening across eligible populations.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Update to Previous USPSTF Recommendations</em></h3>\r\n<p>This is an update of the 2008 USPSTF recommendation.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation27\">27</a>&nbsp;In 2008, the USPSTF recommended screening with colonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT, annual high-sensitivity FOBT, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years combined with high-sensitivity FOBT every 3 years. In the current recommendation, instead of emphasizing specific screening approaches, the USPSTF has instead chosen to highlight that there is convincing evidence that colorectal cancer screening substantially reduces deaths from the disease among adults aged 50 to 75 years and that not enough adults in the United States are using this effective preventive intervention. The reasons for this gap between evidence and practice are multifaceted and will require sustained effort among clinicians, policy makers, advocates, and patients to overcome.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Recommendatoins of Others</em></h3>\r\n<p>Many organizations have issued guidelines concerning screening for colorectal cancer. All of the following recommendations apply to average-risk adults 50 years and older.In 2008, the American Cancer Society, American College of Radiology, and the US Multi-Society Task Force (including the American Gastroenterological Association, American College of Gastroenterology, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) jointly issued recommendations. They prioritized flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, double-contrast barium enema every 5 years, and CT colonography every 5 years as preferred tests &ldquo;designed to both prevent and detect cancer&rdquo; if resources are available but also recommended annual high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT-DNA testing (interval uncertain).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;Shortly thereafter, the American College of Gastroenterology released an independent guideline recommending colonoscopy every 10 years as the single preferred screening strategy. It stated that if colonoscopy is not available or is unacceptable to a patient, recommended alternative strategies include flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years or CT colonography every 5 years (preferred) or annual FIT, annual Hemoccult II SENSA, or FIT-DNA testing every 3 years (acceptable).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation28\">28</a>In 2012, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommended colonoscopy every 10 years as the preferred screening strategy if available; otherwise, it recommended annual gFOBT or FIT, with or without flexible sigmoidoscopy, every 5 years or flexible sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 years as secondary approaches to screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation29\">29</a>In 2015, the American College of Physicians recommended that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened for colorectal cancer by 1 of 4 strategies: 1) annual high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT, 2) flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, 3) high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT every 3 years plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or 4) colonoscopy every 10 years. It advised that average-risk adults younger than 50 years, older than 75 years, or with an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years should not be screened.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation30\">30</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians is in the process of updating its guidelines.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation31\">31</a>In 2016, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended that adults aged 50 to 59 years (weak recommendation) and 60 to 74 years (strong recommendation) be screened for colorectal cancer with gFOBT or FIT every 2 years or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years. It recommended against screening in adults 75 years and older (weak recommendation) and using colonoscopy as a primary screening test (weak recommendation).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation32\">32</a></p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;to update its 2008 recommendation on screening for colorectal cancer. The review addressed the following: 1) the effectiveness of screening with colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, gFOBT, FIT, FIT-DNA, and methylated&nbsp;<em>SEPT9</em>&nbsp;DNA testing in reducing incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer or all-cause mortality; 2) the harms of these screening tests; and 3) the test performance characteristics of these tests for detecting adenomatous polyps, advanced adenomas based on size, or both, as well as colorectal cancer. In contrast to the evidence review performed for the USPSTF in 2008, this review expanded its approach to additionally search for and consider 1) observational evidence about the benefits of screening tests when trial evidence does not exist and 2) comparative effectiveness of screening tests on cancer incidence and mortality.In addition, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the CISNET Colorectal Cancer Working Group<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation12\">12</a>&nbsp;to provide information from comparative modeling on optimal starting and stopping ages and screening intervals across the different available screening methods. Compared with the previous decision analysis performed for the USPSTF, this analysis used more narrowly defined ages at which to begin and end screening and screening intervals. It also included new screening methods (FIT-DNA, CT colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with FIT), updated test characteristics, and age-specific risks of colonoscopy complications.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>All of the available studies of the test characteristics of different screening methods evaluated 1-time application of the test. As such, it is not possible to draw meaningful inferences about the ultimate performance of these tests as intended in a real-world setting (ie, in a program of repeated screening over time).High-sensitivity gFOBT (Hemoccult SENSA; Beckman Coulter) has a sensitivity of 62% to 79% and a specificity of 87% to 96% for detecting colorectal cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Fecal immunochemical tests can be grouped according to whether they are qualitative (fixed cutoff) or quantitative (adjustable cutoff) assays; overall, test performance among this class of stool-based tests varies widely. Sensitivity and specificity of the OC-Light test using a cutoff of 10 &mu;g hemoglobin (Hb)/g feces to detect colorectal cancer range from 79% to 88% and 91% to 93%, respectively;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;sensitivity and specificity of the OC FIT-CHEK family of tests using a cutoff of 20 &mu;g Hb/g feces (as directed by the manufacturer) to detect colorectal cancer range from 73% to 75% and 91% to 95%, respectively.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;In the largest study assessing the test characteristics of the only FIT-DNA test available in the United States (Cologuard; Exact Sciences), its sensitivity and specificity to detect colorectal cancer was 92% (95% CI, 84% to 97%) and 84% (95% CI, 84% to 85%), respectively. Its sensitivity to detect advanced precancerous lesions (advanced adenomas and sessile serrated polyps measuring &ge;1 cm) was 42% (95% CI, 39% to 46%), and its specificity to detect &ldquo;all nonadvanced findings&rdquo; (including nonneoplastic findings and negative colonoscopy findings) was 87% (95% CI, 86% to 87%).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation13\">13</a>&nbsp;A second, smaller study involving Alaska Native individuals confirmed that FIT-DNA testing has higher sensitivity but lower specificity than FITs to detect colorectal neoplasia with 1-time use.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation22\">22</a>Colonoscopy is generally considered the criterion standard for test characteristic studies, although it does miss some cases of colorectal cancer. No studies have evaluated the test performance characteristics of flexible sigmoidoscopy against a colonoscopy standard in an average-risk screening population.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Studies of CT colonography have not been powered to estimate its ability to detect cancer. Studies of CT colonography test performance with bowel preparation found that the per-person sensitivity to detect adenomas measuring 10 mm or larger ranged from 67% to 94%; specificity ranged from 86% to 98%. Only 2 studies evaluated the performance of CT colonography without bowel preparation; they found sensitivity and specificity to detect adenomas measuring 10 mm or larger ranging from 67% to 90% and 85% to 97%, respectively.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence of benefit associated with colorectal cancer screening. The Hemoccult II SENSA test was the first colorectal cancer screening test to demonstrate reduction in disease-specific mortality in an RCT. Six trials showed that after 11 to 30 years of follow-up, screening with low-sensitivity gFOBT reduced the risk of colorectal cancer death by about 9% to 22% when performed biennially (about 9 to 16 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 100,000 person-years) and by about 32% when done annually.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>When considering the life-years gained compared with the burden and harms of screening (as assessed by the proxy measure of total number of lifetime colonoscopies), annual screening with high-sensitivity gFOBT was consistently dominated by annual FIT screening in the CISNET modeling.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a>Flexible sigmoidoscopy has also been assessed in multiple RCTs. Pooled meta-analysis of 4 trials demonstrated that 1-time screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy reduced the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by 27% after about 11 to 12 years (incidence rate ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.82]), or about 9 to 14 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 100,000 person-years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;The Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention Trial found that its flexible sigmoidoscopy&ndash;plus-FIT group had a lower colorectal cancer&ndash;specific mortality rate than the flexible sigmoidoscopy&ndash;only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.90] vs 0.84 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.17]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation14\">14</a>&nbsp;The CISNET models estimated that screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy from the ages of 50 to 75 years, repeated every 5 years, would result in about 181 to 227 life-years gained per 1,000 persons screened over a lifetime. However, a combined approach of flexible sigmoidoscopy repeated every 10 years with annual FIT screening was estimated to result in about 246 to 270 life-years gained per 1,000 persons screened (although it would also increase the total number of diagnostic and surveillance colonoscopies required).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a>No RCTs have evaluated the effect of colonoscopy on colorectal cancer mortality, although several are in progress (Spanish COLONPREV, Swedish SCREESCO, and US CONFIRM trials),<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation23\">23-26</a>&nbsp;including 1 trial (Northern European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer) with a control group of no screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation24\">24</a>&nbsp;One large (n=88,902), fair-quality prospective cohort study combining data from the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found an association between self-reported receipt of screening colonoscopy and reduced distal and proximal colorectal cancer mortality (multivariate HR, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.31] and 0.47 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67], respectively).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation15\">15</a>&nbsp;Although the investigators adjusted for known potential risk factors for colorectal cancer, given the study design, they could not address unknown or unmeasured confounders. In addition, it is unclear based on the study design whether the benefit accrued from 1 or multiple colonoscopies or screening plus surveillance colonoscopy. Overall, the study likely overestimates the magnitude of benefit associated with colonoscopy; the observed effect size in this study also cannot be directly compared with that measured in randomized trials of other colorectal cancer screening methods.The CISNET models commissioned for this review estimated the number of life-years gained, colorectal cancer deaths averted, lifetime colonoscopies required (as a proxy measure for the burden of screening), and resulting complications (ie, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events) for various screening strategies, varying the age at which to start and stop screening and the frequency of screening. With an age to begin screening of 50 years and an age to end screening of 75 years, assuming 100% adherence to screening over a lifetime, 4 screening strategies were estimated to provide an efficient balance of benefits and harms while also providing roughly comparable life-years gained: colonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years combined with annual FIT, and CT colonography every 5 years. For CT colonography, the findings depend on the perspective taken: if lifetime number of colonoscopies is used as the proxy measure for the burden of screening, it is efficient; if cathartic bowel preparations are considered as the proxy measure, it is not efficient. The CISNET models estimated that these strategies would produce about 226 to 275 life-years gained over a lifetime, or about 20 to 24 colorectal cancer deaths averted per 1,000 adults aged 50 to 75 years screened.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence of harms associated with different colorectal cancer screening programs. With all screening methods, positive findings lead to follow-up colonoscopy to resolve the diagnosis; colonoscopy represents the primary source of harms associated with colorectal cancer screening. As an invasive procedure, colonoscopy can produce important morbidity as well as anxiety and discomfort. Bowel preparation may lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, particularly in older adults or those with comorbid conditions; accurate estimates of the rates of these events are not available. If sedation is used during colonoscopy, cardiopulmonary events may rarely occur; the precise frequency of occurrence is also not known.Screening with FIT-DNA and CT colonography each has several unique harms to consider. Screening with FIT-DNA is less specific than screening with FIT<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation\"></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation13\">13</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation22\">22</a>&nbsp;resulting in more false-positive results per screening test and an increased probability of harm from diagnostic colonoscopy. Further, a theoretical concern about FIT-DNA is whether its use might lead to more frequent and invasive follow-up testing in persons who are not at increased risk of colorectal cancer because of patient or clinician concerns about abnormal DNA results. Although modeling can be used to understand the estimated effects of the test&rsquo;s reduced specificity and increased false-positive rate, empirical evidence on appropriate follow-up of abnormal results is lacking, making it difficult to accurately understand the overall balance of benefits and harms of this screening test.Extracolonic findings detected on CT colonography are common, occurring in about 40% to 70% of screening tests.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;About 5% to 37% of these extracolonic findings require diagnostic follow-up, and about 3% need definitive treatment.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;These findings have the potential for both benefit and harm. Potential harms include additional diagnostic testing of an abnormality that is of no clinical importance, as well as treatment of findings that may never threaten a patient&rsquo;s health or even become apparent without screening (ie, overdiagnosis and overtreatment). Radiation-induced cancer is a potential long-term concern with repeated use of CT colonography. No studies directly measured this risk, but radiation exposure during the procedure seems to be low, with a maximum exposure of about 7 mSv per examination.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;In comparison, annual background radiation exposure in the United States is 3 mSv per year per person. Although 7 new studies have examined the potential harms associated with CT colonography since the prior USPSTF review,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;high-quality evidence to draw clear conclusions about the ultimate clinical effect associated with the detection and subsequent workup of extracolonic findings remains lacking. Given the frequency with which these incidental findings occur, it is difficult to accurately understand the overall balance of benefits and harms of this screening test without this information.The direct harms of endoscopy have been somewhat better studied.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Pooled estimates suggest there are about 4 (95% CI, 2 to 5) colonic perforations and about 8 (95% CI, 5 to 14) major intestinal bleeding episodes per 10,000 screening colonoscopies performed.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>Many of these events appear to be related to polypectomy, and the risk of experiencing an adverse event increases with age.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;The risk of bleeding or perforation seems to be greater if the colonoscopy is done as part of diagnostic follow-up of a positive finding on a screening test of a different method; for example, pooled data from flexible sigmoidoscopy trials found about 14 (95% CI, 9 to 26) colonic perforations and 24 (95% CI, 5 to 63) major bleeding episodes per 10,000 persons undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;This compares to about 1 perforation and 2 major bleeding episodes per 10,000 flexible sigmoidoscopies performed for the purposes of cancer screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>The harms from a single administration of a screening test must be considered in the context of how often the test will be repeated over a patient&rsquo;s lifetime. In the case of colorectal cancer screening, this means considering how many colonoscopies (the primary source of serious harms) will be required to follow up abnormal findings. The CISNET models suggest that the available strategies range from an estimated 1,714 to 4,049 total colonoscopies required per 1,000 persons screened over a lifetime; screening colonoscopy every 10 years generates the highest degree of associated burden or harm (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig\">Figure</a>).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in average-risk, asymptomatic adults aged 50 to 75 years is of substantial net benefit. Multiple screening strategies are available to choose from, with different levels of evidence to support their effectiveness, as well as unique advantages and limitations (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#tab\">Table</a>).For older adults aged 76 to 85 years, the benefits of screening for colorectal cancer decline and the risk of experiencing serious associated harms increases. The most important consideration for clinicians and patients in this age group is whether the patient has previously been screened. Patients in this age group who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit than those who have been previously screened. Other factors that should be considered include whether the patient has other chronic health conditions and would be healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer was found.Screening for colorectal cancer is a substantially underused preventive health strategy in the United States.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation19\">19</a>&nbsp;In addition, there are no empirical data to suggest that any of the strategies provide a greater net benefit. Accordingly, the best screening test is the one that gets done, and the USPSTF concludes that maximizing the total proportion of the eligible population that receives screening will result in the greatest reduction in colorectal cancer deaths.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 6 to November 2, 2015. Many comments expressed concern that the terms &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; and &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; to describe the testing strategies lacked clarity and were confusing to interpret. In response, the USPSTF removed these terms from the final recommendation to better communicate the primary message of importance: there is convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer provides substantial benefit for adults aged 50 to 75 years, and a sizable proportion of the eligible US population is not taking advantage of this effective preventive health strategy. With this recommendation, the USPSTF acknowledges that there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach to colorectal cancer screening and seeks to provide clinicians and patients with the best possible evidence about the various screening methods to enable informed, individual decision making. Accordingly, both the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#tab\">Table</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig\">Figure</a>&nbsp;were updated to provide more detailed information about the available evidence on the effectiveness of each method, as well as the strengths, limitations, and unique considerations for the various screening tests.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>The number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis have increased since 2000. In 2014, 19,999 cases (6.3 cases per 100,000 persons) of primary and secondary syphilis were reported in the United States.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Left untreated, syphilis can progress to late-stage disease in approximately 15% of persons who are infected.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Consequences of late-stage syphilis include development of inflammatory lesions throughout the body (eg, aortitis, gummatous lesions, and osteitis), which can lead to cardiovascular or organ dysfunction. Syphilis infection of the central nervous system (neurosyphilis) can occur at any stage of disease and can result in blindness, paresis, tabes dorsalis, and dementia. Syphilis infection also increases the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection.The USPSTF addresses screening for syphilis in pregnant women in a separate recommendation statement.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation3\">3</a></p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>There are numerous screening tests for syphilis. Most common is a combination of nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening algorithms with high sensitivity and specificity are available to accurately detect syphilis.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that treatment with antibiotics can lead to substantial health benefits in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection by curing syphilis infection, preventing manifestations of late-stage disease, and preventing sexual transmission to others.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for syphilis in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for infection. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results that require clinical evaluation, unnecessary anxiety to the patient, and the potential stigma of having a sexually transmitted infection. The harms of antibiotic treatment are well established, and the magnitude of these harms is no greater than small.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for syphilis infection in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for infection is substantial.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and adolescents who are at increased risk for syphilis infection. Screening for syphilis in nonpregnant populations is an important public health approach to preventing the sexual transmission of syphilis and subsequent vertical transmission of congenital syphilis.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. Based on 2014 surveillance data,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;men who have sex with men (MSM) and men and women living with HIV have the highest risk for syphilis infection; 61.1% of cases of primary and secondary syphilis occurred among MSM, and approximately one-half of all MSM diagnosed with syphilis were also coinfected with HIV. One study found that rates of syphilis coinfection were 5 times higher in MSM living with HIV compared with men living with HIV who do not have sex with men.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;Based on older study data from northern California, the adjusted relative risk for syphilis infection in persons living with HIV (vs those without HIV) was 86.0 (95% CI, 78.6 to 94.1); 97% of those living with HIV and with incident syphilis were male.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation5\">5</a>When deciding which other persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. Factors associated with increased prevalence that clinicians should consider include history of incarceration, history of commercial sex work, certain racial/ethnic groups, and being a male younger than 29 years, as well as regional variations that are well described. Men accounted for 90.8% of all cases of primary and secondary syphilis in 2014. Men aged 20 to 29 years had the highest prevalence rate, nearly 3 times higher than that in the average US male population.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Syphilis prevalence rates are also higher in certain racial/ethnic groups (among both men and women); in 2014, prevalence rates of primary and secondary syphilis were 18.9 cases per 100,000 black individuals, 7.6 cases per 100,000 Hispanic individuals, 7.6 cases per 100,000 American Indian/Alaska Native individuals, 6.5 cases per 100,000 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals, 3.5 cases per 100,000 white individuals, and 2.8 cases per 100,000 Asian individuals.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;The southern United States comprises the largest proportion of syphilis cases (41%); however, the case rate is currently highest in the western United States (7.9 cases per 100,000 persons). Metropolitan areas in general have increased prevalence rates of syphilis.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;Risk factors for syphilis often do not present independently and may frequently overlap. In addition, local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area.Although direct evidence on screening among nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low. Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Current screening tests for syphilis rely on detection of antibodies rather than direct detection of the organism. Screening for syphilis infection is a 2-step process involving an initial nontreponemal test (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) followed by a confirmatory treponemal antibody detection test (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] or&nbsp;<em>Treponema pallidum</em>particle agglutination [TPPA] test). A reverse sequence screening algorithm has been developed in which an automated treponemal test (such as enzyme-linked, chemiluminescence, or multiplex flow immunoassays) is performed first, followed by a nontreponemal test. If the test results are discordant in the reverse sequence algorithm, a second treponemal test (preferably using a different treponemal antibody) is performed.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation6\">6</a>There is limited evidence on the accuracy of screening using the reverse sequence algorithm. Findings from 2 studies suggest that using a reverse sequence algorithm may detect additional cases of syphilis missed by the usual algorithm.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;However, the clinical significance of these additional cases is unclear, and more studies are needed to better understand the implications of using a reverse sequence algorithm for screening in a primary care setting. Newer screening technologies that include rapid syphilis tests are also currently emerging. These tests have the potential to be performed in nontraditional and nonclinical settings; however, more evidence is needed on the effectiveness of these tests as part of a screening program in a primary care setting.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>The optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons living with HIV may benefit from more frequent screening. Initial studies suggest that detection of syphilis infection in MSM or persons living with HIV improves when screening is performed every 3 months compared with annually.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>In its 2015 guidelines on the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends parenteral penicillin G benzathine for the treatment of syphilis. Dosage and route may vary depending on the stage of disease and patient characteristics. To obtain the most up-to-date information, clinicians are encouraged to access the CDC website.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation8\">8</a></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>Public health agencies and local health departments have a critical role in the prevention and treatment of syphilis. Local health departments are often responsible for investigating incident cases of syphilis and identifying potential contacts who may need further testing or treatment. Primary care clinicians should be aware of applicable local public health laws and reporting requirements for syphilis cases.</p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Persons who are at risk for or have been diagnosed with syphilis infection may engage in behavior that increases their risk for other sexually transmitted infections. The USPSTF has made a separate recommendation on screening for syphilis in pregnant women, as well as screening for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in sexually active adolescents and adults and behavioral counseling interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",
      "other": "<h2>Other Considerations</h2>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Although testing for syphilis in persons living with HIV may be part of HIV management care provided in a specialty setting, screening for syphilis is often conducted in primary care settings, and primary care clinicians are encouraged to routinely screen their patients who are living with HIV.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Studies are needed that directly evaluate the effectiveness of screening for syphilis on related morbidity and mortality in other high-risk populations, in addition to MSM and persons living with HIV, as well as studies that help identify optimal screening intervals. Studies in adolescent populations are particularly needed. In addition, studies that evaluate the effectiveness of risk assessment instruments or other methods to identify persons who are at increased risk and who may benefit from screening are needed. Further, studies on the diagnostic accuracy of reverse sequence screening algorithms in well-defined patient populations are needed, as well as studies on the interpretation and management of discrepant serology results (such as a positive automated treponemal test, negative nontreponemal test, and positive second treponemal test).</p>\r\n<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>This recommendation is consistent with and updates the 2004 USPSTF recommendation. The current recommendation statement includes updated information on prevalence and risk factors in the United States and data on newer screening tests and approaches. Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women is now addressed in a separate recommendation statement.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation3\">3</a></p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2>\r\n<p>The CDC recommends at least annual screening for sexually active MSM with confirmatory testing for individuals with reactive serology. Persons living with HIV should be screened at least annually; more frequent screening may be appropriate based on individual risk behaviors and local epidemiology. The CDC also recommends syphilis screening in correctional facilities on the basis of the local area and institutional prevalence.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses the CDC&rsquo;s guidelines.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation20\">20</a>&nbsp;The HIV Medicine Association (part of the Infectious Diseases Society of America) recommends that all patients living with HIV be screened for syphilis on initiation of care and periodically thereafter, depending on risk.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation21\">21</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation22\">22</a></p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Syphilis is a chronic, systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium&nbsp;<em>T pallidum</em>. Left untreated, syphilis can progress through the following stages: primary, secondary, latent (early and late), and tertiary disease. Syphilis infection of the nervous system (neurosyphilis) can occur at any stage. Although not always present or noticed by patients, manifestations of primary syphilis include ulcers or a single chancre at the infection site. Manifestations of secondary syphilis include rash, mucocutaneous lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Manifestations of tertiary syphilis include inflammatory lesions of the cardiovascular system (eg, aortitis or coronary vessel disease), skin (eg, gummatous lesions), bone (eg, osteitis), or other tissue. Rarely, other structures may be involved. Manifestations of early neurosyphilis include cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis stroke, acute altered mental status, and auditory or ophthalmic abnormalities; late neurologic manifestations include tabes dorsalis and general paresis and can occur 10 to 30 years after initial infection.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;Syphilis can be sexually transmitted during the early stages of infection (primary, secondary, and early-latent syphilis); reported transmission rates range from 15.9% to 30.3%.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation10\">10</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation11\">11</a>&nbsp;Congenital or vertical transmission may occur at any stage.

The case count (19,999 cases) and case rate (6.3 cases per 100,000 persons) of primary and secondary syphilis were the highest reported since 1994. All but 24 cases occurred in persons 15 years and older. Among men, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis has increased every year since 2000; however, among women, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis has fluctuated between 0.8 and 1.7 cases per 100,000 since 2000. During 2013&ndash;2014, the rate among men increased 14.4%, from 10.2 to 11.7 cases per 100,000; among women, the rate increased 22.7%, from 0.9 to 1.1 cases per 100,000.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;The majority of cases of primary and secondary syphilis still occur among MSM. In 2014, there were 23,541 cases (7.4 cases per 100,000 persons) of late and late-latent syphilis.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>More recently, the CDC has reported an increase in cases of ocular syphilis, with more than 200 cases reported in 20 states since 2014, the majority of which have been among MSM living with HIV.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation15\">15</a></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;of studies published since it previously reviewed the evidence on this topic in 2004.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation17\">17</a>The USPSTF also considered evidence from its previous evidence review. Included studies had to be applicable to the United States, as determined by the similarity of study participants and availability of health care services and screening tests in the study setting. The review focused on screening for syphilis infection in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and adolescents, including patients coinfected with other sexually transmitted infections (such as HIV).</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for syphilis is usually a 2-step process. A nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL) is performed first, followed by a treponemal test (TPPA or FTA-ABS) if the first nontreponemal test result is positive. Positive results on both tests indicate past or present syphilis infection. Estimated sensitivities of the RPR and VDRL tests are 86% and 78%, respectively, for detecting primary syphilis infection; 100% for detecting secondary syphilis infection; and 98% and 96% for detecting latent syphilis infection, respectively.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;Specificity ranges from 85% to 99% and may be reduced in persons who have a preexisting condition (ie, collagen vascular disease, pregnancy, intravenous drug use, advanced malignancy, tuberculosis, malaria, or viral and rickettsial diseases) that may produce false-positive results.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;The TPPA and FTA-ABS tests have a sensitivity of 88% and 84%, respectively, for detecting primary syphilis infection and almost 100% for detecting other stages, and a specificity of 96% to 97%, respectively.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a>Screening yield using the 2-step process (RPR followed by confirmatory FTA-ABS) can be estimated using test characteristics and the incidence of syphilis infection in a given population. For example, in the general population (assuming prevalence of 5 cases per 100,000 persons, RPR sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 95%, and FTA-ABS sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 96%), more than 24,000 patients would have to be screened to detect a single case of syphilis infection; further, 200 per 100,000 persons screened would have false-positive results. In a high-risk population (assuming prevalence of 12%, RPR sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 95%, and FTA-ABS sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 96%), 10 patients would have to be screened to detect a single case of syphilis infection; almost 2,000 per 100,000 persons screened would have false-negative results.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a>More recently, automated treponemal tests have been developed, including enzyme-linked, chemiluminescence, and multiplex flow immunoassays. Reported sensitivity ranges from 64% to 100% (depending on stage of disease and type of test used), and specificity ranges from 95.4% to 99.9%.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;These automated treponemal tests are often used in a reverse sequence screening algorithm, in which an automated treponemal test is performed first, followed by a nontreponemal test (quantitative) if the first automated treponemal test result is positive. A positive result on both the automated treponemal and the nontreponemal test indicates past or present syphilis infection. If the result of the automated treponemal test is positive but the nontreponemal test result is negative, a second treponemal test (TPPA, FTA-ABS, or other) is performed; a positive result on the second treponemal test indicates past or present syphilis infection.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation6\">6</a>The USPSTF reviewed 2 studies that compared a reverse sequence screening algorithm with the traditional 2-step approach to screening.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation18\">18</a>,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation19\">19</a>&nbsp;One study was conducted in a low-prevalence US population<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation19\">19</a>&nbsp;and the other in a high-prevalence metropolitan area in Canada.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;Although both studies found that more cases were detected using the reverse sequence algorithm, use of the reverse sequence algorithm was associated with a higher false-positive rate. Overall, more studies on the reverse sequence screening algorithm are needed before definitive conclusions can be made on its effectiveness.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Based on CDC data,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;MSM and persons living with HIV are at highest risk for syphilis infection. In 2014, the majority of cases (61.1%) of primary and secondary syphilis occurred among MSM, and approximately one-half of all MSM diagnosed with syphilis were also coinfected with HIV. Increased prevalence of syphilis infection was also associated with certain racial/ethnic groups (black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals had higher prevalence rates than white individuals, ranging from 6.5 to 18.9 vs 3.5 cases per 100,000 persons), geography (southern and western United States and metropolitan areas), and being a male younger than 29 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a>The USPSTF found no recent studies on the direct effectiveness of screening for syphilis in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and adolescents to reduce complications or transmission of syphilis infection or acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections. Older clinical trials and observational studies and almost 50 years of clinical experience provide evidence that penicillin is effective in the treatment of syphilis infection.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;Penicillin G has long been an effective and accepted regimen for the treatment of all stages of syphilis infection, and new trials are focusing on antibiotics that are easier to administer or are alternatives for patients who are allergic to penicillin. Data on these alternative regimens are limited.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;Given the well-documented risk factors associated with increased prevalence of syphilis infection and the availability of accurate screening tests and treatment, the USPSTF found overall that screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection is effective.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies directly evaluated the harms of screening. Potential harms of screening include opportunity costs to the clinician and patient (eg, time and resources) and false-positive results that may lead to stress, labeling, and further diagnostic workup. Harms of treatment include rare adverse drug-related effects, such as anaphylaxis due to penicillin allergy and the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (febrile reaction with headache, myalgia, and other symptoms), which may occur within the first 24 hours after any syphilis therapy.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation9\">9</a></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for syphilis infection in asymptomatic, nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for infection provides substantial benefit. Accurate screening tests are available to identify syphilis infection in populations at increased risk. Effective treatment with antibiotics can prevent progression to late-stage disease, with small associated harms, providing an overall substantial health benefit.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 15, 2015 to January 18, 2016. A few comments sought clarification on which populations were considered to be at increased risk. The USPSTF added language to the Clinical Considerations section to clarify that men and women living with HIV who are not MSM are considered to be at increased risk for syphilis. In addition, men and women (and not just young men) who have identified sociodemographic risk factors associated with increased prevalence rates of syphilis may be considered at increased risk as well. In response to public comments, the USPSTF provided updated surveillance data from 2014. A few comments also requested additional information on various screening tests. However, these tests are outside the scope of this recommendation for various reasons (eg, diagnostic tests performed in symptomatic patients or newer technologies not yet evaluated for screening in a primary care setting).</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Skin cancer includes melanoma and basal and squamous cell carcinoma. Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, known together as nonmelanoma skin cancer, are the most common types of cancer in the United States and represent the vast majority of all cases of skin cancer (&gt;98%).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;However, nonmelanoma skin cancer rarely results in death or substantial morbidity (&lt;0.1% of patient deaths are caused by this type of cancer), whereas melanoma skin cancer has notably higher mortality rates.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;For this reason, although a visual skin examination by a clinician will detect all 3 of these cancer types, in understanding the potential benefit of screening, the USPSTF prioritized outcomes related to melanoma in developing this recommendation statement. In 2016, an estimated 76,400 US men and women will develop melanoma and 10,100 will die from the disease.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a></p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence is adequate that visual skin examination by a clinician has modest sensitivity and specificity for detecting melanoma. Evidence is more limited and inconsistent regarding the accuracy of the clinical visual skin examination for detecting nonmelanoma skin cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation2\">2</a></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence is inadequate to reliably conclude that early detection of skin cancer through visual skin examination by a clinician reduces morbidity or mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence is adequate that visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer leads to harms that are at least small, but current data are insufficient to precisely bound the upper magnitude of these harms. Potential harms of skin cancer screening include misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, and the resulting cosmetic and&mdash;more rarely&mdash;functional adverse effects resulting from biopsy and overtreatment.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefit and harms of visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults who do not have a history of premalignant or malignant skin lesions. Patients who present with a suspicious skin lesion or who are already under surveillance because of a high risk of skin cancer, such as those with a familial syndrome (eg, familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome), are outside the scope of this recommendation statement.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Skin cancer of any type occurs more commonly in men than in women and among persons with a fair complexion, persons who use indoor tanning beds, and persons with a history of sunburns or previous skin cancer. Specific risk factors for melanoma include having a dysplastic nevus (atypical mole), having multiple (ie, &ge;100) nevi, and having a family history of melanoma.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;Like most types of cancer, the risk of melanoma increases with age; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years, and the median age at death is 69 years.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1\">1</a></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Benefit of Early Detection and Treatment</h4>\r\n<p>Direct evidence to assess the effect of screening with a clinical visual skin examination on the risk of death from skin cancer is limited.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;A single ecologic study (Skin Cancer Research to Provide Evidence for Effectiveness of Screening in Northern Germany [SCREEN]) with important methodological limitations suggests that a 1-time, general population-based screening program (with limited participation of 19%) combined with a disease awareness campaign may result in, at most, 1 fewer death due to melanoma per 100,000 persons over a decade.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation5\">5</a>&nbsp;An independent analysis of the SCREEN population found that the observed melanoma mortality rate returned to preintervention levels after 5 years of follow-up (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#fig\">Figure</a>).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation6\">6</a></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h4>\r\n<p>Information on the harms of screening is also sparse.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;The majority of suspicious skin lesions excised during screening are not cancerous; for example, the SCREEN study found that between 20 and 55 excisions were performed to detect 1 case of melanoma, depending on patient age.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;The SCREEN study did not report the number of excisions required to prevent 1 death from melanoma, but it can be estimated at more than 4,000. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment&mdash;the diagnosis and treatment of cancer that would never have harmed the patient in the absence of screening&mdash;are other important potential harms. Ecologic evidence suggests that screening with a visual skin examination results in the overdiagnosis of skin cancer;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation8\">8</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;however, current evidence is insufficient to be reliably certain of the magnitude of this effect.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Contemporary data on clinician practice patterns related to skin cancer screening are limited. A 2005 survey of US physicians found that 81% of dermatologists, 60% of primary care physicians, and 56% of internists reported performing a full-body visual skin cancer screening examination on their adult patients.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation10\">10</a></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The clinical visual skin examination assesses skin lesions using the &ldquo;ABCDE rule,&rdquo; which involves looking for the following characteristics: asymmetry, border irregularity, nonuniform color, diameter greater than 6 mm, and evolving over time.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\n<p>The optimal interval for visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer, if it exists, is unknown.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of screen-detected melanoma generally involves excision, with or without lymph node management, depending on the stage at diagnosis. There are a variety of treatments available for squamous and basal cell carcinoma (which have excellent cure rates), including surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, radiation therapy, curettage and electrodessication, and cryosurgery, among other options.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends that children, adolescents, and young adults aged 10 to 24 years who have fair skin be counseled about minimizing their exposure to ultraviolet radiation to reduce their risk of developing skin cancer.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation11\">11</a></p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made a number of recommendations related to preventing skin cancer through the use of interventions that target child care centers; outdoor occupational, recreational, and tourism settings; primary and middle schools; and communities (available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html\">www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html</a><a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer\">This link goes offsite.

      "other": "<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes the challenge of conducting a definitive randomized clinical trial (RCT) on primary screening, with cause-specific mortality as an end point, to provide clear evidence on the efficacy of the clinical visual skin examination in screening for skin cancer, given the comparatively low rate of death from melanoma in the population (even among persons at higher risk). If adequately powered RCTs are not possible, a&nbsp;high-quality case-control study could provide sufficient power without requiring a large sample size. However,&nbsp;this study design has limitations in the ability to create an appropriate comparison group, the ability to accurately measure the exposure of interest (because of recall bias and other sources of misclassification), healthy volunteer bias (persons receiving skin examinations likely have other good health habits), and other unmeasured sources of confounding. Studies would have to be carefully designed to avoid these threats to validity. Despite these challenges, the USPSTF concludes that further evidence is necessary to advance the field on this essential question. An optimized version of the SCREEN study (ie, a time-series study), in which the clinical visual skin examination alone, without the potential confounding of a second intervention, is evaluated, would also be useful. Additional research on the possible harms of screening for skin cancer&mdash;particularly the potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment&mdash;is also needed to help fully understand the ultimate net benefit of the clinical visual skin examination.</p>\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation updates the 2009 USPSTF recommendation.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF has again concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefit and harms of screening for skin cancer in adults with a clinical visual skin examination. However, the USPSTF decided to no longer include a statement about patient skin self-examination in the current recommendation. This intervention will be addressed in the USPSTF&rsquo;s update of its recommendation statement on counseling to prevent skin cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>\r\n<p>Most professional organizations in the United States have no specific recommendations about screening for skin cancer with the clinical visual skin examination. The American College of Physicians has no current guidance on skin cancer screening performed by a clinician, nor does the American College of Preventive Medicine (the latter has an archived statement from 1998<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation19\">19</a>). The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefit and harms of visual skin cancer screening in adults.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation20\">20</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Dermatology does not have formal guidelines on skin cancer screening, although it does encourage and provide resources for its physician members to hold free skin cancer screening events for the public.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation21\">21</a>&nbsp;The American Cancer Society recommends that adults 20 years and older who receive periodic health examinations should have their skin examined as part of a general cancer-related checkup.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation22\">22</a></p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;to update its 2009 recommendation on screening for skin cancer. The review addressed several questions about screening for skin cancer with the clinical visual skin examination, including its effectiveness in reducing skin cancer morbidity and mortality and death from any cause; its potential harms, including any harms resulting from associated diagnostic follow-up; its test characteristics when performed by a primary care clinician versus a dermatologist; and whether its use leads to earlier detection of skin cancer compared with usual care.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;Unlike in the previous review, the evidence concerning patient self-examination for skin cancer was not included in this statement. The visual skin self-examination will be addressed in a separate recommendation statement on counseling to prevent skin cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>A systematic review of 11 studies on the diagnostic accuracy of screening by primary care clinicians and dermatologists identified during the previous evidence review found that screening by primary care clinicians had a sensitivity of 42% to 100% and a specificity of 98% for the diagnosis of melanoma.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation12\">12</a>&nbsp;Since then, 2 additional studies on the test characteristics of the clinical visual skin examination have been published: 1 evaluating screening performed by primary care clinicians and 1 evaluating screening performed by dermatologists or plastic surgeons. These studies found that sensitivity ranged from 40% to 70%, which sharply decreased as the length of follow-up increased (from 12 to 24 or 36 months). Specificity ranged from 86% to 98%.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation13\">13</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation14\">14</a>&nbsp;None of the studies could draw reliable conclusions as to whether screening performed by any of the clinical specialties differed in diagnostic accuracy.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation12\">12-14</a></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No RCT has directly evaluated the effectiveness of the clinical visual skin examination for reducing skin cancer morbidity or mortality (a pilot study by Aitken et al in Queensland, Australia, began in 2002, but a full trial was never completed).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;A single fair-quality ecologic study (SCREEN) compared trends in melanoma mortality rates in 1 region of Germany using a population-based skin cancer awareness campaign, clinician education and training, and clinical visual skin examination provided through a cancer screening program with several surrounding regions that did not have similar interventions available. After a 2-year public skin cancer awareness campaign, 360,288 adults 20 years and older (about 19% of the eligible population) received a single clinical visual skin examination. After 10 years, the study found a 48% relative reduction in the risk of dying from melanoma in the region that instituted the interventions compared with the control regions, which translates into an absolute reduction of 1 fewer death from melanoma per 100,000 persons screened.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation15\">15</a>The SCREEN study has several important limitations. First, it does not provide individual patient-level data on the effect of the clinical visual skin examination, and as an ecologic observational study, it is subject to the potential effects of known and unknown biases and confounders. Second, the separate effects of the public education component cannot be disentangled from those of the clinical visual skin examination component; therefore, it is likely that the effect of screening alone is smaller than estimated. In addition, the melanoma mortality rate in the region receiving the interventions was already declining prior to the introduction of the cancer screening program. This also suggests that the 48% relative reduction overestimates the true effect size of screening. Several other data points raise questions about the plausibility of the observed effect: 1) only 19% of the total eligible population was actually screened, and 37% of these individuals were lost to follow-up, yet the relative magnitude of the mortality reduction in the population is larger than in almost any other cancer screening intervention currently available; and 2) three-fourths of the population screened were women, yet equal reductions in melanoma mortality were observed among both men and women.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation15\">15</a>&nbsp;Furthermore, an independent study evaluating an additional 5 years of follow-up in the SCREEN study population found that the observed reduction in melanoma mortality rates did not persist over time but essentially returned to the baseline rates observed before the screening program was initiated (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#fig\">Figure</a>).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation6\">6</a>When direct, overarching evidence concerning the benefit of a screening intervention on health outcomes is inconclusive, the USPSTF looks to a chain of indirect evidence to assess the effectiveness of the preventive service. In the case of the clinical visual skin examination, this includes linking together information about the ability of screening to detect melanoma earlier than in usual care and the link between earlier detection of skin cancer and resultant morbidity and mortality. The USPSTF identified only 1 fair-quality case-control study pertaining to the question of whether screening for skin cancer with a clinical visual skin examination leads to the earlier detection of melanoma compared with usual care.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;It found a modest association between the clinical visual skin examination and early detection (odds ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.98]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;However, because the study used patient self-report to identify exposure to clinician skin examination, recall bias is a potential concern.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence on the harms of the clinical visual skin examination is limited.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;In the SCREEN study, approximately 4.4% of screened individuals (1 of 23 participants) underwent a skin excision for a suspicious lesion. The majority of these biopsies did not result in a cancer diagnosis. Overall, for both men and women, 1 case of melanoma was detected per 28 excisions performed. However, this varied greatly by patient age. For example, among men aged 20 to 34 years versus 65 years and older, 1 case of melanoma was detected per 52 versus 20 skin excisions, respectively.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation7\">7</a>Cosmetic or, more rarely, functional adverse effects may also result from an excisional biopsy prompted by clinical visual skin examination, although there are few data available on the frequency or specific details of these events. One fair-quality study of a single physician&rsquo;s performance of skin cancer screening and razor-blade shave biopsy among patients who were not ultimately diagnosed with skin cancer found that 7% of these patients expressed poor satisfaction with the cosmetic results (whereas the physician felt the results were poor in 16% of cases).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3\">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation17\">17</a>Overdiagnosis and overtreatment&mdash;the identification and treatment of cancer that would never have harmed the patient in the absence of screening&mdash;is also a potential outcome of concern. It is not possible to directly determine for any individual patient whether a diagnosed cancer will progress or not; as such, measuring overdiagnosis is not a straightforward process and must be indirectly quantified. In the case of skin cancer, there is limited research to estimate the potential magnitude of the burden of overdiagnosis associated with screening. An ecologic study linking melanoma incidence and mortality data from the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program with Medicare claims for skin biopsy among patients 65 years and older found that from 1986 to 2001, the average incidence of melanoma increased 2.4 times (from 45 to 108 cases per 100,000 persons), while the average biopsy rate increased 2.5 times (from 2847 to 7222 biopsies performed per 100,000 persons). However, the increased cancer incidence was entirely due to extra cases of in situ and local disease, without the expected complementary decrease in the incidence of advanced melanoma or death from melanoma. The authors concluded that this pattern strongly suggested that screening efforts in the United States were generating overdiagnosis, rather than depicting a true increase in the occurrence of melanoma.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation8\">8</a></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence to assess the net benefit of screening for skin cancer with the clinical visual skin examination is limited. Direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening in reducing melanoma morbidity and mortality is limited to a single fair-quality ecologic study with important methodological limitations. This study suggests that, at best, a program of public education and disease awareness coupled with 1-time visual skin examination by a clinician may reduce the risk of dying from melanoma among average-risk adults by about 1 death per 100,000 persons screened after 10 years; however, there are reasons to believe that the effect size is likely smaller. The indirect pathway of evidence (ie, examining the accuracy of screening; link between visual skin examination and earlier detection of melanoma, such as lesion thickness; and the link between earlier detection of melanoma and skin cancer&ndash;related morbidity and mortality) and the studies included as part of this pathway are subject to several important biases of screening, including lead-time bias and length-biased sampling. These biases preclude the USPSTF&rsquo;s ability to draw reliable conclusions about the efficacy of the clinical visual skin examination with reasonable certainty. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to reliably conclude whether screening for skin cancer with a clinical visual skin examination reduces melanoma morbidity or mortality.Information on harms is similarly sparse. The potential for harm clearly exists, including a high rate of unnecessary biopsies, possibly resulting in cosmetic or&mdash;more rarely&mdash;functional adverse effects, and the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. It is difficult for the USPSTF to accurately bound the magnitude of these potential harms without better information about the frequency with which skin cancer is likely overdiagnosed and overtreated. Further, it is challenging for the USPSTF to correctly bound the magnitude of the net benefit without more accurate and precise information about the size of the potential mortality benefit, if one exists. As such, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefit and harms of screening for skin cancer in adults with a clinical visual skin examination.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 1 through December 28, 2015. In response to the comments received, the USPSTF added a reference to a study that examined longer-term melanoma mortality rates in the SCREEN study population.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation6\">6</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF also clarified that the recommendation does encompass all forms of skin cancer (ie, squamous and basal cell carcinoma and melanoma). A clinical visual skin examination will detect all skin cancer types; however, in assessing the potential benefit of screening, the USPSTF focused on melanoma because the associated morbidity and mortality rates for this type of skin cancer are substantially greater than for the others. In addition, although the systematic evidence review searched for studies of all skin cancer types, the evidence that met the prespecified inclusion criteria for the review only described efficacy outcomes for melanoma.Several comments stressed that the USPSTF should place greater emphasis on the benefits of detecting and treating nonmelanoma skin cancer, noting the risk for such cancer to become locally destructive and lead to disfigurement if left untreated. Although the USPSTF agrees that reduced morbidity from nonmelanoma skin cancer or its requisite treatment would be an important benefit of screening, there is currently no evidence available to address this outcome for the clinical visual skin examination. It is therefore unknown whether there is an incremental benefit to detecting nonmelanoma skin cancer through a program of regular visual clinical examination versus patient self-identification as part of general body awareness followed by reasonably prompt evaluation by a clinician.Several comments suggested that the USPSTF should consider making a separate positive recommendation for persons who are at increased risk for skin cancer (eg, those with a family history of melanoma), as they may potentially benefit more from a screening intervention. At present, there is insufficient evidence for&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;population that regular visual skin examination by a clinician can reduce skin cancer&ndash;related morbidity and mortality; the USPSTF agrees that targeted research among populations with the highest burden of disease would be useful.</p>",

      "rationale": "<p><strong>Importance</strong>Dyslipidemia, a genetic or multifactorial disorder of lipoprotein metabolism, is defined by elevations in levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non&ndash;high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non&ndash;HDL-C), triglycerides, or some combination thereof, as well as lower levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Elevations in levels of TC, LDL-C, and non&ndash;HDL-C are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in adults, as are lower levels of HDL-C and, to a lesser extent, elevated triglyceride levels. &nbsp;<br>Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia occurs in approximately 1 of every 200 to 500 persons in North America and Europe and is more prevalent among populations with known founder effects (up to 1 of 100 persons) (1-3). Familial hypercholesterolemia is variably defined in the literature but generally includes highly elevated LDL-C levels (eg, &ge;190 mg/dL), genetic mutation, or both.&nbsp;Alternatively, dyslipidemia can be a multifactorial disorder, with both polygenic and environmental causes, including obesity. Multifactorial dyslipidemia is defined by elevations in levels of LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL [to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]), TC (&ge;200 mg/dL [to convert TC values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]), or both that are not attributable to familial hypercholesterolemia (4-6). Obesity is associated with slight elevations in LDL-C; it is more strongly related to elevated triglycerides and lower HDL-C. &nbsp;Recent estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that 7.8% of children aged 8 to 17 years have elevated levels of TC (&ge;200 mg/dL), and 7.4% of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years have elevated LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL) (1, 4, 5).&nbsp;The rationale for screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents is that early identification and treatment of elevated levels of LDL-C could delay the atherosclerotic process and thereby reduce the incidence of premature ischemic cardiovascular events in adults.&nbsp;<strong>Detection</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the quantitative difference in diagnostic yield between universal and selective screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia.&nbsp;<strong>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia.&nbsp;<em>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</em>The USPSTF found adequate evidence from short-term trials (&le;2 years) that pharmacotherapy interventions result in substantial reductions in levels of LDL-C and TC in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. One short-term pharmacotherapy trial reported a reduction in carotid intima-media thickness. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to address whether treatment with short-term pharmacotherapy leads directly to a reduced incidence of premature cardiovascular disease (eg, myocardial infarction or stroke). The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association between changes in intermediate lipid outcomes or noninvasive measures of atherosclerosis in children and adolescents and incidence of or mortality from relevant adult health outcomes. &nbsp;<em>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</em>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of lifestyle modification or pharmacotherapy interventions in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia to improve intermediate lipid outcomes or atherosclerosis markers or to reduce incidence of premature cardiovascular disease. &nbsp;<strong>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the harms of screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the long-term harms of treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia in children or adolescents. Long-term evidence on the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia was limited to 1 study of statins. Short-term statin use was generally well tolerated in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia, with transient adverse effects (such as elevated liver enzyme levels). Treatment with bile acid-sequestering agents was commonly associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence to assess the harms of treatment of multifactorial dyslipidemia in children or adolescents. One trial of a low-fat, low-cholesterol dietary intervention in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia showed no harms.&nbsp;<strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong> The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in asymptomatic children and adolescents 20 years or younger cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children and adolescents 20 years or younger without a known diagnosis of a lipid disorder.&nbsp;<strong>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em>Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused primarily by mutations in the LDL receptor (<em>LDLR</em>) gene (NCBI Entrez Gene 3949) that causes severe elevations in levels of LDL-C, resulting in early atherosclerotic lesions. Children with familial hypercholesterolemia can have TC and LDL-C levels 2 to 3 times higher than those of unaffected children. Familial hypercholesterolemia is generally asymptomatic in childhood and adolescence and is rarely associated with cardiovascular events in the first 2 decades of life (1). The burden of familial hypercholesterolemia is attributable to premature cardiovascular events in adulthood resulting from long-term exposure to elevated serum cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis.&nbsp;Studies conducted before statin use became common suggest that familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with a cumulative incidence of ischemic heart disease in 1 of 6 men and 1 of 10 women by age 40 years. By age 50 years, 25% of women and 50% of men with untreated familial hypercholesterolemia will experience clinical cardiovascular disease (5). Coronary artery disease occurs in 50% of men by age 50 years and 30% of women by age 60 years (7, 8). Mortality from coronary artery disease is greater in adults younger than 60 years with familial hypercholesterolemia. Among adults surviving to age 60 years, the risk of coronary heart disease approaches that of the general population (1, 9).&nbsp;Multifactorial dyslipidemia is defined by elevated levels of LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL) or TC (&ge;200 mg/dL) that are not attributable to familial hypercholesterolemia (2). Several longitudinal studies have documented an association between childhood lipid levels in this range and measures of atherosclerosis in adulthood (1). Studies show that tracking lipid levels from childhood and adolescence to adulthood cannot predict which individuals will have elevated LDL-C or TC as adults (2). In addition, the association between multifactorial dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence and clinical cardiovascular disease in adulthood is unknown. &nbsp;<em>Potential Harms</em>Most children with elevated lipid levels of a multifactorial origin will not progress to a clinically important lipid disorder or develop premature cardiovascular disease and are therefore subject to overdiagnosis. Screening could result in the labeling of children with a &ldquo;nondisease,&rdquo; parental or child anxiety, or unnecessary or harmful testing and treatment. The adverse effects of long-term use of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification (including diet and physical activity) have not been adequately studied. &nbsp;<em>Current Practice</em>Generally, screening rates for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents seen in primary care have been low. According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2.5% of well-child visits included lipid testing in 1995, and 3.2% included it in 2010 (10). Claims data from health insurance plans report rare use of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy in 8- to 20-year-olds. Among more than 13 million children, 665 children initiated lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy between 2005 and 2010, for an overall incidence rate of 2.6 prescriptions per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.1 to 2.7) (11).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Screening Tests</strong>Normal lipid level values for children and adolescents are currently defined by population distributions of lipid levels from the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study, which was conducted in the 1970s (2, 12). In 1992, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) proposed fixed threshold values to define dyslipidemia in children (TC &ge;200 mg/dL, LDL-C &ge;130 mg/dL, or both). These values are slightly lower than the 95th percentile observed in the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study for both boys and girls at nearly all ages, although there are some age-related variations in adolescence (2, 13).&nbsp;Cholesterol levels vary by sex and age throughout childhood. Total cholesterol levels increase from birth, stabilize at approximately age 2 years, peak before puberty, and then decline slightly during adolescence (2, 14). The accepted cutoff values for elevated LDL-C and TC may overidentify or underidentify children and adolescents, depending on age and sex (2). Abnormal lipid levels in youth are based on population distributions, not associations with health outcomes. It is unclear to what degree elevated lipid levels in children and adolescents 20 years or younger are associated with future disease risk. &nbsp;Elevated lipid levels track modestly into adulthood, making it difficult to predict which children and adolescents will continue to have elevated cholesterol levels as adults (2, 15, 16). Longitudinal studies suggest that elevated LDL-C levels in adolescence predict elevated LDL-C 15 to 20 years later, with a positive predictive value of 32.9% to 37.3% and lower predictive values among younger children (17).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Levels of TC may be measured with fasting or nonfasting serum testing . Serum (or plasma) TC and HDL-C levels do not change appreciably according to a fasting or nonfasting state. Serum LDL-C levels may be calculated using the Friedewald formula (LDL-C = TC &minus; [triglycerides/5] &ndash; HDL-C). Because accurate calculation depends on triglyceride levels, serum testing requires a fasting state. Direct measurement of LDL-C does not require fasting and is preferred when triglyceride levels are greater than 400 mg/dL (2). Recent guidelines on screening for dyslipidemia in children recommend measuring either LDL-C or non&ndash;HDL-C levels (18).&nbsp;Screening strategies for dyslipidemia in clinical practice include selective or universal screening. Selective screening is based on family history of dyslipidemia or premature cardiovascular disease. Universal screening is based only on age. Cascade screening is a common screening strategy for familial hypercholesterolemia in other countries. Cascade screening involves case-finding among relatives of patients with confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia and testing for genetic variants identified in the first affected relative (ie, the proband). However, the US health system does not currently have the infrastructure to implement cascade screening (2).&nbsp;There are no universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. Studies of children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia use several different diagnostic criteria. All of the criteria use a combination of elevated lipid levels, physical findings, family history, or genetic tests to establish the diagnosis (1).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Treatment of Dyslipidemia</strong>Interventions for dyslipidemia include lifestyle modification (eg, changes in diet and physical activity) and pharmacotherapy (eg, statins, bile-acid sequestering agents, or cholesterol absorption inhibitors).&nbsp;Statins, or 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have been widely adopted for use in adults with hypercholesterolemia, because these drugs are effective at reducing cardiovascular events in high-risk adults. As a result of their efficacy in adults, statins are one of the first-line medications considered for use in children and adolescents with hypercholesterolemia (2, 19).&nbsp;The appropriate age at which to start statin use in children with familial hypercholesterolemia is subject to debate. Some experts recommend starting statin use at age 8 or 10 years; others, concerned with adverse effects, recommend initiating use at age 20 years (2). The long-term effects of statin use in children and adolescents are unknown.&nbsp;<strong>Useful Resources</strong> The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer them or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation) (20). The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for primary hypertension in asymptomatic children and adolescents to prevent subsequent cardiovascular disease in childhood or adulthood (I statement) (21). These recommendations are available on the USPSTF website (<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong>Randomized trials of screening programs are needed to assess the benefits and harms of combined screening and treatment programs for familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents. For both familial hypercholesterolemia and multifactorial dyslipidemia, long-term, controlled treatment trials of lipid-lowering medications, supplements, dietary interventions, or combinations thereof are needed to assess harms, as well as effectiveness to improve intermediate and health outcomes in adulthood (1, 2). These trials should be conducted in racially and ethnically diverse US populations. In the absence of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening programs, treatment studies in patients with screen-detected multifactorial dyslipidemia would be informative. In addition, longitudinal studies would help to understand the association between intermediate outcomes in childhood and adolescence and premature myocardial infarction and stroke in adulthood (1, 2). With these studies, it may be possible to consider age- and sex-specific (rather than fixed) cutoff values to define thresholds for abnormal levels of TC and LDL-C (2).&nbsp; There is doubt that long-term RCTs of statin use in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia can be feasibly and ethically conducted. The feasibility of conducting such trials may increase with use of intermediate outcomes that predict coronary heart disease (2, 22).<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong>&nbsp;This recommendation updates the 2007 USPSTF recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in children, adolescents, and young adults. This recommendation is similar to the previous recommendation in that the evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents remains insufficient.<strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong>&nbsp; The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&rsquo;s Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents (18) and the American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; Bright Futures (31) recommend universal screening before adolescence (ages 9 to 11 years) and again after puberty (ages 17 to 21 years). Selective screening (eg, based on family history and other risk factors) is recommended for younger children starting at age 2 years. The American Academy of Family Physicians (32) states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for lipid disorders in infants, children, adolescents, or young adults (up to age 20 years). The UK National Screening Committee (33) indicates that there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening, although a project is currently under way to evaluate cascade screening.&nbsp;</p>",
      "discussion": "<p><strong>Burden of Disease</strong>Data from the 2011&ndash;2012 NHANES estimate the prevalence of elevated TC levels in children aged 8 to 17 years as 7.8%, and data from the 2007&ndash;2010 NHANES estimate the prevalence of elevated LDL-C levels in adolescents as 7.4% (4, 5). These are likely overestimates of the true prevalence of dyslipidemia because of within-person variability. Repeat testing in an individual is necessary to reliably identify children and adolescents with elevated lipid levels (2, 4, 5, 12).&nbsp;Much attention has been directed at screening for dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence because atherosclerosis starts in youth; lipid levels in youth are associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in adulthood; familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature ischemic cardiovascular disease; short-term treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia with statins substantially lowers LDL-C levels and, based on 1 study, improves measures of atherosclerosis; abnormal lipid levels in adulthood have been strongly associated with the risk of coronary heart disease events; and early identification and intervention with cholesterol-lowering therapy in certain populations of adults can prevent such events.&nbsp;Screening in children and adolescents may identify those with undiagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia. However, the clinical health benefits and risks among children and adolescents identified with and treated for dyslipidemia have not been sufficiently studied, making the role of screening in children and adolescents uncertain.&nbsp;<strong>Scope of Review</strong>To update its 2007 recommendation (23), the USPSTF commissioned 2 systematic evidence reviews on screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents 20 years or younger. The USPSTF decided to conduct 2 separate reviews based on public comment on the draft research plan&mdash;1 on screening for familial hypercholesterolemia and 1 on screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia. The review on familial hypercholesterolemia focused on heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and secondary causes of dyslipidemia (such as diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, or hypothyroidism) were outside the scope of the review.&nbsp;<strong>Accuracy of Screening Tests</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</em>The review identified 2 fair-quality studies of universal screening for familial hypercholesterolemia. Both studies took place in school settings. The first study, the Coronary Artery Risk Detection in Appalachian Communities (CARDIAC) project, was a universal screening program (n=81,156) in West Virginia schools intended to identify the prevalence of cardiac risk factors, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance (24). The second study was a Danish screening study (n=2085) that measured apolipoprotein levels as a screening test for familial hypercholesterolemia. No studies on selective screening for familial hypercholesterolemia were identified (1, 25).&nbsp;The CARDIAC project reported a diagnostic yield of about 1.3 cases per 1000 persons screened when familial hypercholesterolemia was diagnosed based on an LDL-C level greater than 155 mg/dL, a TC level greater than 260 mg/dL, or both, plus DNA evidence of a genetic mutation in a first- or second-degree relative (24). The Danish study identified 10 children based on laboratory testing and a family history consistent with familial hypercholesterolemia, for a diagnostic yield of 4.8 cases per 1000 persons screened (1, 25).&nbsp;<em>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia </em>No studies on selective screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia were identified. No studies screened for multifactorial dyslipidemia by measuring levels of non&ndash;HDL-C.&nbsp;An Ohio study (n=6500) used a nonfasting TC threshold level of 200 mg/dL or greater to universally screen for multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents. The prevalence of elevated nonfasting TC was 8.5%. After confirmatory testing using a fasting LDL-C threshold level of 130 mg/dL or greater, the positive predictive value was 77% and the diagnostic yield was 5.8% (2, 26).&nbsp;Population-based studies suggest that approximately 8% to 11% of children and adolescents would screen positive using the NCEP nonfasting TC threshold level of 200 mg/dL or greater. Point estimates of the prevalence of elevated TC from 3 large, population-based US studies were combined with the positive predictive value derived from the Ohio study to simulate diagnostic yield (screening yield &times; positive predictive value of the initial screening). Simulated diagnostic yield ranged from 4% to 12% for different subgroups based on age and body mass index. Subgroups with the highest diagnostic yield were children with obesity (12.3%) and overweight (8.9%), children aged 9 to 11 years (7.2%), and adolescents aged 16 to 19 years (7.2%) (2).&nbsp;<strong>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</em>No direct evidence was found that reported on selective or universal screening and intermediate or health outcomes in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia.&nbsp;Thirteen randomized, blinded trials (n=1789) examined the effectiveness of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy in children and adolescents. No evidence on the effectiveness of dietary supplements or lifestyle interventions on intermediate outcomes in children with familial hypercholesterolemia was found. The 13 fair- to good-quality trials included 8 trials of statins, 3 trials of bile-acid sequestering agents, and 2 trials of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (1).&nbsp;Trials included 54 to 248 participants whose ages ranged from 6 to 18 years (mean age range, 12 to 15 years). Both sexes were well represented. In trials reporting race/ethnicity, the majority of trial participants were white. The trials were conducted in countries with a high Human Development Index (&gt;0.9). Participants were patients at tertiary care lipid clinics. Trial duration ranged from 6 weeks to 2 years, with most lasting less than 1 year. All trials excluded participants with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, secondary dyslipidemia, or use of medications that could affect lipid levels. Familial hypercholesterolemia was defined on the basis of elevated fasting lipid levels and family history, using various standard criteria (1).&nbsp;Statin trials included pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin. The studies reported statistically significant reductions in LDL-C levels from baseline, with most effect sizes ranging from 20% to 40% compared with placebo. Because of the variability in medication, dosage, and duration of treatment, data were not pooled across trials (1).&nbsp;Dose response was seen in 2 trials of pravastatin and rosuvastatin (1). The greatest effect on levels of LDL-C was in a trial of rosuvastatin. In that trial&mdash;the only statin trial that reported treatment target levels&mdash;only 12% to 41% of participants reached the target LDL-C level of less than 110 mg/dL, with greater effects at higher doses. Participants who received the highest dose (20 mg/d) had a 50% reduction (least squares mean estimate) in LDL-C from baseline, compared with 1% in the control group (P&lt;0.001). The effects of statins on HDL-C were mixed, with some trials reporting minimal improvement and others showing no change. Trials that evaluated TC levels found reductions of 20% to 30% from baseline compared with placebo. One trial of pravastatin reported a 2.0% reduction in carotid intima-media thickness in the treatment group, compared with a 1.0% increase in the control group. The mean change in carotid intima-media thickness differed significantly between groups (P=0.02) (1). No trials assessed the effect of statins on pathologic findings or coronary calcium scores.&nbsp;Three trials of bile acid-sequestering agents (colesevelam, cholestyramine, and colestipol) reported more modest effects on levels of LDL-C and TC, with similar effect sizes across trials. The trial of colesevelam showed a dose response. Only 3.2% to 7.9% of participants reached the target LDL-C level of 110 mg/dL or less, with greater effects at higher doses (1).&nbsp;One drug, an intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe, studied in 2 RCTs), also showed smaller effects on levels of LDL-C in a trial of combination therapy with simvastatin. Ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 54% compared with a 38% reduction using simvastatin alone. In a trial assessing ezetimibe monotherapy compared with placebo, ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 28% (95% CI, -31 to -25) from baseline compared with a negligible change in the placebo group (1).&nbsp;No evidence was found on lifestyle modification alone or dietary supplements as treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia in children or adolescents. No evidence was found on the effectiveness of interventions in childhood or adolescence on cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood. There was also a lack of evidence on the association between intermediate outcomes in childhood or adolescence and health outcomes in adulthood among those with familial hypercholesterolemia (1).&nbsp;<em>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</em>No direct evidence was found that evaluated selective or universal screening and intermediate or health outcomes in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia (2).&nbsp;There is also a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of treatment in childhood on adult health outcomes. However, 2 trials addressed the effectiveness of treatment on intermediate outcomes in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia (2).&nbsp;A good-quality trial, the Dietary Intervention Study in Children (n=663), evaluated a modified NCEP Step II diet (low fat and low cholesterol) delivered using an intensive multiyear, family-based counseling intervention in children aged 8 to 10 years (27). Trial participants had a mean baseline LDL-C level of 131 mg/dL, which is near the minimum threshold for dyslipidemia. Outcomes were evaluated at 1, 3, and 5 years after randomization, at the end of the trial (about 8 years after randomization), and 9 years after the end of the trial (about 17 years after randomization). The intervention resulted in statistically significant reductions in mean LDL-C and TC in the intervention vs control groups at 1 and 3 years. The mean adjusted between-group difference was greatest in year 1 (TC, -6.1 mg/dL; LDL-C, -4.8 mg/dL; P&lt;0.001) and smaller but still statistically significant in year 3 (TC, -3.3 mg/dL [P=0.04]; LDL-C, -3.3 mg/dL [P=0.02]). However, the groups did not differ significantly at years 5, 7, or 18 (2, 27).&nbsp;A small fair-quality trial (n=32) of flaxseed supplementation (30 g/d) in children aged 8 to 18 years with moderate to severe dyslipidemia found no effect at 4 weeks on levels of TC or LDL-C (2, 28).&nbsp;One fair-quality longitudinal study (n=9245) of adolescents and young adults (aged 12 to 39 years) from the NHANES evaluated the association between mortality before age 55 years and several cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid levels. In multivariate models, neither highly elevated TC (&ge;240 mg/dL) nor moderately increased TC (200 to 239 mg/dL) was independently associated with death (all causes and endogenous causes) when both sexes were combined. Extremely elevated TC (&ge;240 mg/dL) was associated with a greater risk of death (endogenous causes) before age 55 years (relative hazard ratio, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.31 to 5.08]) in females only. However, this estimate was based on a small number of deaths (29). In addition, this study did not report on cardiovascular mortality, an outcome more closely linked to the causal pathway. &nbsp;A good-quality trial suggests that a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet combined with intensive counseling has a modest effect on levels of LDL-C in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia (2, 27), but the effect dissipates with time. No evidence was found on dietary supplements for the treatment of multiple dyslipidemia in children or adolescents. No evidence was found on the effectiveness of interventions in childhood or adolescence on cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood. There was also a lack of evidence on the association between intermediate outcomes in childhood or adolescence and health outcomes in adulthood among those with multiple dyslipidemia (2).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</em><em></em>No studies reported on the harms of screening for familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents. Evidence was available from short-term trials of pharmacotherapy in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia. The USPSTF evaluated 18 fair- to good-quality trials (n=2210) for the harms of treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents, including 13 trials of statins, 3 trials of bile acid-sequestering agents, and 2 trials of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe). Most were applicable to the US primary health care setting. Trial duration ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years (1). Bile acid-sequestering agents were commonly associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. Statins were well tolerated; elevated liver enzyme levels, creatine kinase levels, or both were observed in some studies but were transient. Ten trials evaluated the effects of statin use on growth or sexual maturation and found no reported abnormalities. Ezetimibe was well tolerated in short-term trials (1).&nbsp;Overall, evidence of treatment harms was limited to only 1 long-term study. The study was a 10-year cohort follow-up of a 2-year trial of pravastatin followed by continued statin use over the intervening years. Sex hormone levels were measured in young adult siblings (mean age, 24 years). Young men with familial hypercholesterolemia had lower dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (within normal ranges) compared with their unaffected siblings. However, this difference is of unknown clinical significance (30).&nbsp;<em>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</em>No studies were found that reported on the harms of screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents.<strong></strong>&nbsp;The only trial that evaluated harms of treatment in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia was the Dietary Intervention Study in Children, which evaluated a dietary intervention combined with behavioral counseling in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia. This good-quality trial demonstrated no harms in anthropometric, laboratory, psychosocial, or sexual maturation measures during the trial or long-term follow-up (18 years), suggesting that low-fat, low-cholesterol dietary interventions may not be harmful in children (2).&nbsp;<strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the quantitative difference in diagnostic yield between universal and selective screening approaches. There is inadequate evidence on the effectiveness and harms of long-term treatment and the harms of screening. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the association between changes in intermediate outcomes (eg, lipid levels or noninvasive measures of atherosclerosis) and improvements in adult cardiovascular health outcomes. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents 20 years or younger is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.&nbsp;<strong>How Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</strong>Left untreated, familial hypercholesterolemia leads to premature clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in adulthood resulting from long-term exposure to elevated levels of serum cholesterol. Cardiovascular events rarely occur in the first 2 decades of life, typically taking place during the fourth decade. Because of the lack of evidence on the long-term benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy, it is not known whether there is benefit to initiating treatment in childhood vs later in adolescence or adulthood. It is also not known if improvement in intermediate outcomes results in improvement in adult health outcomes.&nbsp;Multifactorial dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence is a risk factor for future atherosclerosis. Although elevated lipid levels can continue into adulthood, they do so inconsistently, making it difficult to predict which children and adolescents will have elevated cholesterol as adults. The relationship between dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease in adults has been well established; however,<strong> </strong>the association between multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents and future disease risk in adults is unknown. <strong></strong>&nbsp;<strong>Response to Public Comment</strong> A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 22, 2015, to January 25, 2016. The USPSTF reviewed all comments received. A few comments agreed with the insufficiency of the evidence; several comments disagreed with the recommendation. A few comments provided citations for related articles, and the USPSTF reviewed these for relevance to the current recommendation. The USPSTF added language to emphasize the burden of familial hypercholesterolemia and to clarify its diagnosis. The USPSTF also added language on the feasibility of research to the section on Research Needs and Gaps.&nbsp;</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>In the United States, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later reactivate and progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the United States is difficult to determine; however, based on 2011&ndash;2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, estimated prevalence is 4.7% to 5.0%.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation1\">1</a> Tuberculosis is spread through respiratory transmission. Approximately 30% of persons exposed to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>will develop LTBI and, if untreated, approximately 5% to 10% of these persons will progress to active tuberculosis disease or reactivation of tuberculosis.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2-6</a> Rates of progression may be higher in persons with certain risk factors or medical conditions. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active tuberculosis disease is the identification and treatment of LTBI to prevent its progression to active disease. Traditionally, prevention of tuberculosis has relied on public health systems; however, more recently, screening for LTBI has become a relevant primary care issue.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests are available to detect LTBI. Screening tests include the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs); both are moderately sensitive and highly specific.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment<strong> </strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct benefits of screening for LTBI. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of LTBI with regimens recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decreases progression to active tuberculosis; the magnitude of this benefit is moderate.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for LTBI. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of treatment of LTBI with CDC-recommended regimens is small. The primary harm of treatment is hepatotoxicity.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis is moderate. </p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 18 years and older at increased risk for tuberculosis (see the &ldquo;Assessment of Risk&rdquo; section for more information). It does not apply to adults with symptoms of tuberculosis or to children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Populations at increased risk for LTBI based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with increased tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters and correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at risk in their community, because local demographic patterns may vary across the United States.In 2015, among persons of known national origin, 66.2% of all active tuberculosis cases in the United States were among foreign-born persons, and the case rate of active tuberculosis among foreign-born persons was approximately 13 times higher than among US-born persons (15.1 vs 1.2 cases per 100,000 persons).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;More than half of all foreign-born persons in the United States with active tuberculosis were from 5 countries: Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, and China.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;In addition, the CDC has identified foreign-born persons from Haiti and Guatemala as important contributors to active tuberculosis cases in the United States.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation8\">8</a>&nbsp;The World Health Organization (WHO) recently updated its list of countries with a high burden of tuberculosis to include the top 20 countries with the highest absolute numbers of cases and an additional 10 countries with the most severe burden in terms of case rate per capita.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation9\">9</a>Persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and increased risk for exposure. Among persons 15 years and older with active tuberculosis, 5.6% were homeless within the past year, 2.2% were residents of a long-term care facility, and 4.2% were in a correctional facility at the time of diagnosis.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation10\">10</a>&nbsp;Published prevalence rates of LTBI in these settings vary widely, depending on the type of screening test used, the TST threshold used to define the presence of LTBI, and the population studied. Estimates of LTBI prevalence range from 23.1% to 87.6% among prisoners and from 18.6% to 79.8% among persons who are homeless.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation11\">11</a>Other populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who are immunosuppressed (eg, persons living with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important subgroup.Persons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Since screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation12\">12</a>&nbsp;or employee health<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation13\">13</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation14\">14</a>&nbsp;surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations. Clinicians seeking further information about testing for tuberculosis in these populations can refer to the &ldquo;Useful Resources&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recommendations of Others&rdquo; sections.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Two types of screening tests for LTBI are currently available in the United States: the TST and IGRA. The TST requires intradermal placement of purified protein derivative and interpretation of response 48 to 72 hours later. The skin test reaction is measured in millimeters of the induration (a palpable, raised, hardened area or swelling). Interferon-gamma release assays require a single venous blood sample and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. Two types of IGRAs are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: T-SPOT.<em>TB</em> (Oxford Immunotec Global) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (Qiagen).Numerous patient and systems factors may influence the selection of a screening test.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation15\">15</a> Generally, the CDC recommends screening with either the TST or IGRA but not both. Testing with IGRAs may be preferable for persons who have received a bacille Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin vaccination or persons who may be unlikely to return for TST interpretation. Additional information on the use and interpretation of the TST and IGRA is available from the CDC.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation16\">16</a></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for LTBI. Depending on specific risk factors, screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons who are at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those who are at continued risk of exposure.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Recommendations for the treatment of LTBI are available from the CDC.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation17\">17</a></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The public health system has an essential role in the control and elimination of tuberculosis. Clinicians are required to report cases of active tuberculosis to their local health department. As outlined by local and state public health laws, local health departments investigate and ensure treatment of active tuberculosis cases and perform contact tracing and medical surveillance of contacts.Occupational health services also have an important role in the prevention and control of tuberculosis. Certain work settings (health care settings, correctional facilities, and other high-risk congregate housing settings) may pose a higher risk of tuberculosis exposure, and employers often have an important role in preventing tuberculosis exposure among employees and performing medical surveillance of employees for exposure.</p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Clinicians seeking guidance on tuberculosis management among persons living with HIV can obtain additional information from the National Institutes of Health.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking information on medical surveillance of contacts of persons with active tuberculosis can contact their local health department, review their local public health law, or review guidance from the CDC.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation19\">19</a>&nbsp;The CDC also provides information for public health tuberculosis programs.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation20\">20</a>Clinicians seeking information on medical surveillance of health care workers or employees working in high-risk settings can consult resources from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation21\">21-23</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking guidance on screening for LTBI in children can find more information on the American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; Bright Futures website.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation24\">24</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking guidance on tuberculosis and pregnancy can obtain information from the CDC.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation25\">25</a></p>",
      "other": "<p></p>\r\n<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Screening with the TST requires that patients return 48 to 72 hours after administration of the skin test for interpretation of results. When placing a TST, clinicians should plan with patients accordingly to ensure they can return in time and that the facility is able to interpret the test results within the proper time frame.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation26\">26</a> Screening with an IGRA requires obtaining a single venous blood sample, and patients do not need to return for interpretation of results. However, clinicians should be aware of processing requirements for blood samples and ensure that venous blood samples are drawn and can reach the laboratory for processing within the appropriate time frame (8 to 30 hours, depending on the test).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation27\">27</a></p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Further research is needed that evaluates risk assessment tools to determine efficient ways of identifying candidates for LTBI testing and treatment. Additional research on how often LTBI screening should be performed in different subpopulations is also needed. The USPSTF identified no studies on LTBI screening or treatment in pregnant women and the potential effects on the fetus; this represents an important gap in the literature that needs further research. In addition, more studies are needed to clarify whether certain screening methods are preferable for certain risk groups.</p>\r\n<h3>Update of USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF last issued a recommendation on screening for tuberculosis in 1996. At that time, the USPSTF recommended screening for tuberculosis infection with the TST in asymptomatic, high-risk persons (A recommendation) and consideration of bacille Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin vaccination for selected high-risk individuals only (B recommendation). Given the changes in the epidemiology of the disease, the development of newer screening technologies, and newer methods for developing evidence-based recommendations, the USPSTF decided to update the topic and issue a recommendation using its current methodology and considering all of the available evidence, including studies published prior to 1996.</p>\r\n<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation34\">34</a> In 2005, the CDC, the American Thoracic Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America issued joint guidelines recommending that clinicians screen for LTBI only among high-risk populations and when treatment is feasible.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation35\">35</a> In its 2013 \"Guide for Primary Health Care Providers,\" the CDC recommended targeted testing for tuberculosis among high-risk populations only.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation8\">8</a> The CDC identifies persons at risk for developing tuberculosis as those who have an increased likelihood of exposure to persons with tuberculosis disease (known close contacts of a person with infectious tuberculosis disease, persons who have immigrated from tuberculosis-endemic regions of the world, and persons who work or reside in facilities or institutions with those at high risk for tuberculosis) or persons with clinical conditions or other factors associated with an increased risk of progression from LTBI to tuberculosis disease (HIV infection, injection drug use, radiographic evidence of prior healed tuberculosis, low body weight, or other medical conditions). Further information on targeted testing is available from the CDC.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation36\">36</a>The WHO also recently issued guidelines on the management of LTBI. For high-income countries with an estimated tuberculosis incidence of less than 100 cases per 100,000 persons (such as the United States), the WHO recommends systematic testing for and treatment of LTBI among persons living with HIV, adult and child contacts of persons with pulmonary tuberculosis, patients initiating anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment, patients receiving dialysis, patients preparing for an organ or hematologic transplant, and patients with silicosis. Either an IGRA or the TST should be used. The WHO also recommends considering systematic testing and treatment among prisoners, health care workers, immigrants from high-burden countries, homeless persons, and illicit drug users. Either an IGRA or the TST should be used. It does not recommend systematic testing for LTBI among persons who have diabetes, engage in harmful alcohol use, smoke tobacco, or are underweight, unless they are already included in the above recommendations.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation37\">37</a> Further information is available from the WHO.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation38\">38</a>.</p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Tuberculosis causes a substantial health burden globally. Approximately one-third of the world&rsquo;s population is infected with tuberculosis; in 2014, 9.6 million persons were estimated to have contracted tuberculosis, and an estimated 1.5 million deaths related to tuberculosis infection occurred worldwide.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation9\">9</a>&nbsp;In the United States, 9563 new active cases of tuberculosis were reported in 2015, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 3.0 cases per 100,000 persons.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;In 2013, 555 deaths from tuberculosis were reported in the United States.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation28\">28</a>&nbsp;In 2015, half of all tuberculosis cases occurred in 4 states: California, Texas, New York, and Florida. Asians represented the largest percentage of total cases (33%), followed by Hispanics (28%), African Americans (21%), and whites (13%); American Indian or Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders each represented approximately 1% of cases.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;Incidence rates of active tuberculosis may be higher in populations at increased risk, owing to greater likelihood of exposure (eg, persons who have lived in countries with a high tuberculosis burden) or greater likelihood of progression from LTBI to active disease (eg, persons who are immunosuppressed). Although LTBI is asymptomatic, signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis disease may include cough, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), unexplained weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills, and fatigue.</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on screening for LTBI.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation3\">3</a>&nbsp;Evidence dating from the inception of searched databases until August 3, 2015, was included. The review focused on evidence on screening for LTBI in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care settings. It did not include evidence on screening in persons for whom LTBI screening would be considered management of a specific condition (eg, persons living with HIV), public health surveillance (ie, tracing contacts of persons with active tuberculosis disease), surveillance of employees working in high-risk settings, or screening indicated prior to the use of specific immunosuppressive medications.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>There is no direct test for the diagnosis of latent infection with <em>M tuberculosis</em>. Following screening, diagnosis of LTBI is based on medical history, physical examination, and exclusion of active tuberculosis disease. In the absence of a reference standard for detection of LTBI, screening test performance is based on detection of disease in persons with known active tuberculosis and nondetection of disease in populations at low risk for the disease and presumed not to have LTBI or active tuberculosis.The USPSTF identified 67 good- or fair-quality studies that provided information on the accuracy and reliability of screening tests for LTBI.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;For studies reporting on sensitivity, 8 were conducted in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis, 29 were conducted in countries with an intermediate burden, 10 were conducted in countries with a low burden, and 3 were conducted in countries with a mix of low to intermediate burden. For studies reporting on specificity, 3 were conducted in countries with an intermediate burden; 14 were conducted in countries with a low burden; and 1 was conducted in 2 countries: 1 with an intermediate burden and 1 with a low burden.When using a positive threshold of 10 mm of induration, the TST has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for detection of LTBI. Based on pooled analyses of studies reviewed by the USPSTF, when using a positive threshold of 10 mm, the TST has sensitivity of 79% (11 studies; n=988) and specificity of 97% (9 studies; n=9651).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>Pooled analyses of the T-SPOT.<em>TB</em> test (a type of IGRA) indicate sensitivity of 90% (16 studies; n=984) and specificity of 95% (5 studies; n=1810). Pooled analyses of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (another type of IGRA) indicate sensitivity of 80% (24 studies; n=2321) and specificity of 97% (4 studies; n=2053). The USPSTF identified no studies that evaluated the accuracy and reliability of sequential screening strategies.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified no randomized clinical trials that compared screening with no screening to provide direct evidence of the benefit of screening for LTBI on health outcomes, such as rates of active tuberculosis disease, disease-specific or all-cause mortality, or tuberculosis transmission. Three good- or fair-quality trials (n=35,563) conducted in Canada, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia provided evidence on the benefits of treatment of LTBI.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Trials evaluated treatment with isoniazid,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation29\">29</a>&nbsp;rifampin,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation30\">30</a>&nbsp;and rifapentine plus isoniazid.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation31\">31</a>The best evidence on the effectiveness of treatment was from the International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) trial. This good-quality randomized clinical trial was conducted in 7 European countries (Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia) among participants with fibrotic pulmonary lesions but not active tuberculosis. The trial, published in 1982, included 27,830 participants and evaluated treatment with daily isoniazid. It found that at 5 years, the relative risk (RR) of progression to active tuberculosis was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.52) for treatment with isoniazid (300 mg daily for 24 weeks) compared with placebo. The trial reported fewer deaths attributable to tuberculosis among participants receiving treatment with isoniazid (0 vs 3 deaths in the placebo group; RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.01 to 2.78]), although this difference was not statistically significant.The other 2 treatment trials compared either rifampin with isoniazid and found zero deaths in either group or rifapentine plus isoniazid with isoniazid alone and found that the combination therapy was noninferior in preventing progression to active tuberculosis. None of the treatment studies reported on transmission rates of tuberculosis.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified no studies that directly reported on the harms of screening. Potential harms include stigma associated with screening and diagnostic workup and treatment of false-positive results. Five good- or fair-quality studies (n=36,043) conducted in the United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia reported on the harms of treatment.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation29\">29-33</a>&nbsp;Interventions evaluated included isoniazid, rifampin, and rifapentine plus isoniazid. The most consistently reported harm was hepatotoxicity. The only study that assessed harms of treatment vs placebo was the IUAT trial,<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation30\">30</a>&nbsp;which found an RR of 4.59 (95% CI, 2.03 to 10.39) for hepatotoxicity at 5 years among participants being treated with isoniazid (300 mg for 24 weeks) vs placebo. The IUAT trial also reported more deaths from hepatotoxicity among participants being treated with isoniazid than with placebo, although this finding was not statistically significant (0.14 vs 0 deaths per 1000 persons; RR calculated from published data, 2.35 [95% CI, 0.12 to 45.46]).The other trials compared either rifampin<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation30\">30</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation32\">32</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation33\">33</a>&nbsp;or rifapentine plus isoniazid<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation31\">31</a>&nbsp;with isoniazid. Meta-analysis of 3 trials of rifampin compared with isoniazid found a higher RR for hepatoxicity among participants being treated with isoniazid (RR, 3.29 [95% CI, 1.72 to 6.28]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;None of these trials, which were more recent than the IUAT trial, reported any deaths from hepatotoxicity. The 1 study that reported on hepatotoxicity of rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid alone found a nonsignificant reduced RR of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.08) for grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity among participants being treated with rifapentine plus isoniazid. There also was a nonsignificant reduced RR of death from hepatotoxicity among participants being treated with rifapentine plus isoniazid versus isoniazid alone (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.35]).A few studies also reported on gastrointestinal adverse events. Compared with placebo, participants treated with isoniazid had a higher risk of medication discontinuation because of gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.75]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation29\">29</a>&nbsp;Compared with rifampin, treatment with isoniazid had a nonsignificant increased RR of gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 1.60 [95% CI, 0.76 to 3.40]) in 2 studies.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;All 5 studies also reported on discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events. Compared with placebo, treatment with isoniazid had an RR of medication discontinuation of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.89).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation29\">29</a>&nbsp;Pooling results from the 3 studies of isoniazid vs rifampin found a nonsignificant increased risk of discontinuation with isoniazid (RR, 1.61 [95% CI, 0.57 to 4.57]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;The study of rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid alone found an increased risk of discontinuation with rifapentine plus isoniazid (RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.59]).<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation31\">31</a></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests for LTBI are available, treatment of LTBI provides a moderate health benefit in preventing progression to active disease, and the harms of screening and treatment are small. The USPSTF has moderate certainty that screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for infection provides a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF estimated that if a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 asymptomatic adults at increased risk for tuberculosis (eg, persons born in, or former residents of, high-prevalence countries) were screened, 52 to 146 active tuberculosis cases would be prevented, 7 to 67 cases of hepatotoxicity would occur (depending on type of treatment), and 111 persons would discontinue treatment because of adverse events. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of LTBI from progressing to active tuberculosis would range from 111 to 314 (depending on the patient&rsquo;s risk for progression), and the number needed to harm to cause 1 case of hepatotoxicity from treatment would range from 279 to 2531 (depending on type of treatment). These estimates are based on prevalence data from the 2011&ndash;2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;and numerous assumptions about screening sensitivity and specificity (eg, using the TST with a 10-mm threshold for a positive diagnosis) and potential benefits of treatment (eg, estimated efficacy of treatment for 24 weeks of isoniazid, based on IUAT trial findings). Further information on the assumptions used is available in the corresponding evidence review.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a></p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Tuberculosis disease is caused by <em>M tuberculosis</em>, which is spread through airborne transmission when a person with active pulmonary tuberculosis coughs or sneezes. When the tuberculosis bacillus is inhaled, a person can either clear <em>M tuberculosis</em>; develop active disease (primary tuberculosis disease), which may be infectious; or develop latent infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious. Latent infection can later reactivate and progress to active tuberculosis disease. Approximately 30% of persons exposed to active <em>M tuberculosis </em>will develop LTBI.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Approximately 5% to 10% of persons with a positive TST result will experience reactivation of LTBI and progress to active tuberculosis disease.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2\">2-6</a></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from March 8 to April 4, 2016. Many comments sought clarification around risk assessment of populations who should receive screening. The USPSTF clarified that given regional variations in the local populations considered at risk for tuberculosis, clinicians may consult their local or state public health agency for additional details on specific populations at risk in their community. Furthermore, the USPSTF clarified that although persons with diabetes and pregnant women are not addressed separately in this recommendation statement, they are also not excluded from the recommendation. A few public comments sought clarification on the recommended frequency of screening. Although the USPSTF sought evidence on screening frequency, there was not enough evidence available to determine an optimal screening interval. Several comments requested that the recommendation include treatment of LTBI. While the USPSTF acknowledges that treatment of LTBI contributes to the success of LTBI screening, it is beyond the scope of the USPSTF to make any specific recommendations on treatment. The CDC provides treatment guidelines for LTBI.<a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation17\">17</a></p>",

      "rationale": "<h3><strong>Importance</strong></h3>\r\n<p>There is convincing evidence that breastfeeding provides substantial health benefits for children and adequate evidence that breastfeeding provides moderate health benefits for women. However, nearly half of all mothers in the United States who initially breastfeed stop doing so by 6 months, and there are significant disparities in breastfeeding rates among younger mothers and in disadvantaged communities.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation1\">1</a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Effectiveness of Interventions to Change Behavior</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Adequate evidence indicates that interventions to support breastfeeding increase the duration and rates of breastfeeding, including exclusive breastfeeding.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Harms of Interventions to Change Behavior</strong></h3>\r\n<p>There is adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of interventions to support breastfeeding as no greater than small, based on the nature of the intervention, the low likelihood of serious harms, and the available information from studies reporting few harms.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that interventions to support breastfeeding have a moderate net benefit for women and their children. </p>",
      "clinical": "<div>\r\n<h3><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></h3>\r\nThis recommendation applies to pregnant women, new mothers, and their infants and children. Interventions to support breastfeeding may also involve a woman's partner, other family members, and friends. This recommendation does not apply in circumstances where there are contraindications to breastfeeding (e.g., certain maternal medical conditions or infant metabolic disorders, such as galactosemia). The USPSTF did not review evidence on interventions directed at breastfeeding of preterm infants.\r\n<h3><strong>Interventions</strong></h3>\r\nBreastfeeding support can begin during pregnancy and continue through the early life of the child. Primary care clinicians can support women before and after childbirth by providing interventions directly or through referral to help them make an informed choice about how to feed their infants and to be successful in their choice. Interventions include promoting the benefits of breastfeeding, providing practical advice and direct support on how to breastfeed, and providing psychological support. Interventions can be categorized as professional support, peer support, and formal education, although none of these categories are mutually exclusive, and interventions may be combined within and between categories.\r\n<h4><em>Professional Support</em></h4>\r\nProfessional support is 1-on-1 counseling about breastfeeding provided by a health professional (medical, nursing, or allied professionals, including those providing lactation care). Some interventions include the provision of supplies, such as educational materials, nursing bras, and breast pumps. Professional support can include providing information about the benefits of breastfeeding, psychological support (encouraging the mother, providing reassurance, and discussing the mother&rsquo;s questions and problems), and direct support during breastfeeding observations (helping with the positioning of the infant and observing latching). Professional support may be delivered during pregnancy, the hospital stay, the postpartum period, or at multiple stages. It may be conducted in an office setting, in the hospital, through home visits, through telephone support, or any combination of these. Sessions generally last from 15 to 45 minutes, although some programs have used shorter or longer sessions. Most successful interventions include multiple sessions and are delivered at more than 1 point in time.\r\n<h4><em>Peer Support</em></h4>\r\nSimilar to professional support, peer support provides women with 1-on-1 counseling about breastfeeding but is delivered by a layperson (generally a mother with successful breastfeeding experience and a background similar to that of the patient) who has received training in how to provide support. Like professional support, peer support may be delivered through a variety of stages, settings, methods, and durations.\r\n<h4><em>Formal Education</em></h4>\r\nFormal education interventions typically include a formalized program to convey general breastfeeding knowledge, most often in the prenatal period, although some may span time periods. Education is usually offered in group sessions and may include telephone support, electronic interventions, videos, and print materials. They are directed at mothers but may include other family members. Content generally focuses on the benefits of breastfeeding, practical breastfeeding skills (e.g., latching), and the management of common breastfeeding complications; these programs may also offer family members encouragement and advice on how to support the mother.\r\n<h3><strong>Useful Resources</strong></h3>\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on different breastfeeding intervention strategies, including program examples and resources.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation2\">2</a>&nbsp;Another resource is the Surgeon General&rsquo;s \"Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding\".<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation3\">3</a></div>",
      "other": "<h3><em><strong>Other Considerations</strong></em></h3>\r\n<h3><strong>Implementation</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Although there is moderate certainty that breastfeeding is of moderate net benefit to women and their infants and children, not all women choose to or are able to breastfeed. Clinicians should, as with any preventive service, respect the autonomy of women and their families to make decisions that fit their specific situation, values, and preferences.In addition to clinicians&rsquo; direct activities to support breastfeeding, there are system-level interventions intended to promote breastfeeding. System-level interventions include policies, programs, and staff training, usually implemented within hospitals or health care systems. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative is the most widely implemented system-level intervention and is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) \"10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding for Hospitals\".<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation4\">4</a>&nbsp;Other system-level interventions include maternity care practices such as encouraging skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, restricted pacifier use, and distributing breast pumps. Community-based interventions include social marketing initiatives, workplace initiatives, and public policy actions. A comprehensive review of the evidence on the effectiveness of these types of system-level interventions for the purposes of making a recommendation is beyond the scope of the USPSTF. A focused review of system-level interventions is included in the full evidence report,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation5\">5</a>and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides information about individual, system-level, and community-based interventions.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation6\">6</a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></h3>\r\n<p>To better assess how population-level interventions would affect breastfeeding rates, future studies should include women who have not already declared their intention to breastfeed. To better understand the effects of different interventions and patient populations, future research should include adequate sample sizes, clear descriptions of the included populations and comparators, and standardized reporting of outcomes. Studies would be more useful if they are designed to allow assessment of the relative contributions of individual components of multicomponent breastfeeding support programs. Trials should include reliable and valid measures of infant and maternal health outcomes and be powered to detect potential effects on these outcomes. Studies also should explore maternal satisfaction with the intervention and any potential negative feelings or feelings of inadequacy that could result if mothers choose not to or are unable to breastfeed. Studies in populations with low breastfeeding rates are especially needed, and more research is needed to better understand the root causes of breastfeeding disparities and how they can be addressed through health care and community interventions. Other areas for research include the potential benefits and harms of supporting indirect breastfeeding (e.g., use of breast pumps), the role of breastfeeding support for adoptive or surrogate families, the role of systems to distribute donor breast milk, and the effect of new technologies to support breastfeeding (e.g., web- or computer-based interventions).</p>\r\n<h3><em>Update of USPSTF Recommendations</em></h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation updates the 2008 USPSTF recommendation on primary care interventions to promote and support breastfeeding. The scope of the review and type of interventions recommended did not change. The grade of the recommendation remains a B.</p>\r\n<h3><em>Recommendations of Others</em></h3>\r\n<p>Several national and international organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation15\">15</a>&nbsp;the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;and WHO/UNICEF,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation17\">17</a>&nbsp;recommend exclusive breastfeeding up to around 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding for at least 1 year, as mutually desired by mother and infant, while complementary foods are introduced. ACOG also recommends that all obstetrician-gynecologists and other providers of obstetric care develop and maintain knowledge and skills in anticipatory guidance and support each woman&rsquo;s informed decision about whether to initiate or continue breastfeeding. ACOG endorses the integration of the WHO/UNICEF \"10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding\" into maternity care to increase the likelihood that women achieve their personal breastfeeding goals.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation16\">16</a>&nbsp;AAP recommends that pediatricians serve as breastfeeding advocates and educators, provides resources that pediatricians can use in their practices, and endorses the WHO/UNICEF \"10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding\".<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation15\">15</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends providing interventions during pregnancy and after birth to support breastfeeding.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation18\">18</a>&nbsp;The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners endorses the optimization of infant breastfeeding and breastfeeding promotion as part of pediatric care.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation19\">19</a>&nbsp;In 2011, the US Surgeon General issued a call to action that clinicians, health systems, community programs, and government policy support women who choose to breastfeed.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation3\">3</a></p>",
      "discussion": "<h3><strong>Benefits of Breastfeeding</strong></h3>\r\n<p>A history of being breastfed has been found to be associated with a reduced risk of a variety of negative health outcomes in infancy and childhood, including illnesses such as acute otitis media, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and gastrointestinal tract infection, and chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation5\">5</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;Although the majority of studies are observational and definitions and comparisons vary widely, any breastfeeding appears to be more beneficial than no breastfeeding, and longer durations of breastfeeding confer greater benefits than shorter durations. Breastfeeding is also associated with positive maternal health outcomes, such as reduced risk of maternal breast and ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Breastfeeding Rates</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Estimates for any breastfeeding among infants born in 2012 in the United States were 80.0% for initiation, 51.4% at 6 months, and 29.2% at 12 months. Rates of exclusive breastfeeding through 3 and 6 months were 43.3% and 21.9%, respectively.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation1\">1</a>&nbsp;These rates have been increasing over the past few decades but are still less than the Healthy People 2020 targets for initiating breastfeeding (81.9%), breastfeeding to 6 months (60.6%), and breastfeeding to 12 months (34.1%). Targets for exclusive breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months are 46% and 25%, respectively.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation8\">8</a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Scope of Review</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2008 recommendation on primary care interventions to promote breastfeeding.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation5\">5</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation7\">7</a>&nbsp;This update focused on the effectiveness of interventions to support breastfeeding on breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity. The USPSTF briefly reviewed the literature on the effects of breastfeeding on child and maternal health outcomes published since the previous review to ensure that there have been no major changes in the direction of the evidence but did not formally assess the literature. The population of interest included mothers of full- or near-term infants and members of the mother-infant support system (e.g., partners, grandparents, or friends). The review used a broad conception of primary care interventions that encompassed activities initiated, conducted, or referred by primary care clinicians.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Effectiveness of Interventions to Change Behavior and Outcomes</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine the direct effects of interventions to support breastfeeding on child and maternal health outcomes. Six trials reported inconsistent effects of counseling interventions on a range of infant health outcomes, including gastrointestinal illness, otitis media, respiratory tract illness, and health care use. None of the studies reported maternal health outcomes.<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation5\">5</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation9\">9-14</a>However, the USPSTF found evidence that interventions to support breastfeeding can increase the rate and duration of breastfeeding. An analysis of 43 trials found that breastfeeding support and education interventions targeting women were associated with a higher likelihood of any and exclusive breastfeeding at less than 3 months and at 3 to 6 months compared with usual care. Pooled estimates indicate a beneficial association for any breastfeeding at less than 3 months (risk ratio [RR], 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.11]; 26 studies) and at 3 to 6 months (RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.18]; 23 studies) and for exclusive breastfeeding at less than 3 months (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33]; 22 studies) and at 3 to 6 months (RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.38]; 18 studies). At 6 months, individual-level interventions among women were associated with a 16% higher likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding (RR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.32]; 17 studies) but not any breastfeeding. The association between individual-level interventions and breastfeeding initiation was not significant, based on the pooled point estimate (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.02]; 14 studies).<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation5\">5</a>&nbsp;Based on these data, it can be projected that for every 30 women offered support, 1 additional woman will breastfeed for up to 6 months.Despite great variation in interventions and study design, there was little evidence that the effects of individual-level interventions vary across different populations or intervention characteristics, although the variability may have masked such relationships. There was some suggestion that interventions taking place during a combination of prenatal, peripartum, or postpartum time periods were more effective than those taking place only during 1 time period. Some data also suggested that interventions are effective in both adolescents and adults. All 4 trials of individual-level interventions among adolescents or young adults reported higher rates of breastfeeding among intervention versus control group participants.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Potential Harms of Interventions to Support Breastfeeding</strong></h3>\r\n<p>There are very few data on the potential harms of interventions to support breastfeeding, which in theory could include guilt related to not breastfeeding, increased anxiety about breastfeeding, and increased postpartum depression. Only 2 trials among adults reported on adverse events related to a breastfeeding support intervention. One trial found no significant differences in maternal anxiety between groups at 2 weeks. The other trial reported that a few mothers expressed feelings of anxiety and decreased confidence in their breastfeeding ability despite breastfeeding going well and discontinued their participation in the peer counseling intervention.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></h3>\r\n<p>There is adequate evidence that interventions to support breastfeeding change behavior and that the harms of these interventions are no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that interventions to support breastfeeding have a moderate net benefit.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 26 to May 23, 2016. Many comments expressed concern that the recommendation did not explicitly include the term \"promotion\" of breastfeeding. The USPSTF interprets support as including promotion. The USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify that it has not changed its confidence in the benefits of breastfeeding and that it continues to recommend interventions to encourage breastfeeding. The USPSTF also clarified that there has been no change from the previous recommendation in the type of interventions being recommended. Other comments expressed concern that the recommendation would lead to undue pressure on women who decide not to breastfeed. The USPSTF reviewed the language in the recommendation to ensure that the autonomy of women is respected. Comments also requested that the USPSTF address policy- and society-level barriers to breastfeeding; although these are indeed important issues, they are beyond the scope of the USPSTF.</p>",

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting for 1 of every 3 deaths among adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation5\"><span>5</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Statins are a class of lipid-lowering medications that function by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is involved in the rate-limiting step in the production of cholesterol. Statins reduce levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C and, to a lesser extent, triglycerides, and probably have anti-inflammatory and plaque stabilization effects as well.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Benefits of Statin Use</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events (MI or ischemic stroke) and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of &nbsp;CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10%.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude whether initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CVD events and mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Statin Use</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small. Randomized, clinical trials (RCTs) of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. However, evidence concerning the association between statin use and diabetes mellitus is mixed, with 1 prevention trial suggesting that there may be a small increased risk of developing diabetes with use of high-dose statins. Myalgia is a commonly reported adverse effect of statins, but placebo-controlled trial data do not support the conclusion that statin use has a major causative role in its occurrence. Evidence for cognitive harms is relatively sparse; further research would be needed to more definitively establish the relationship between statin use and cognitive function. The USPSTF found no clear evidence of decreased cognitive function associated with statin use. These findings are consistent with those from a recent systematic review of RCTs and observational studies assessing the effect of statins on cognition that found no effect on incidence of Alzheimer disease or dementia.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation7\"><span>7</span></a></sup> The recently published HOPE-3 (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 3) trial found that statin use increased risk of cataract surgery, which was unanticipated and not a predetermined outcome of the trial.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup> None of the other primary prevention trials reported this outcome.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation9\"><span>9</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older without a history of heart attack or stroke.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10% has a small net benefit. The decision to initiate therapy in this population should reflect an assessment of patients&rsquo; specific circumstances and their preference for a potential small benefit relative to the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a lifelong daily medication.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years and older without a history of CVD.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Risk Factors for CVD</h3>\r\n<p>For the purposes of this recommendation, dyslipidemia is defined as an LDL-C level greater than 130 mg/dL or a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level less than 40 mg/dL (to convert HDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259). Most participants enrolled in trials of statin use for the prevention of CVD had an LDL-C level of 130 to 190 mg/dL or a diabetes diagnosis; hypertension and smoking were also common among trial participants.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> Persons with an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL were usually excluded from trial participation, as it was not considered appropriate to randomly assign them to placebo. Thus, these recommendations do not pertain to persons with very high cholesterol levels (ie, LDL-C &gt;190 mg/dL) or familial hypercholesterolemia, as they were excluded from most prevention trials.</p>\r\n<p>One trial, JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), which excluded persons with dyslipidemia or diabetes, evaluated the effect of high-dose rosuvastatin vs placebo in participants with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10\"><span>10</span></a></sup> The USPSTF previously reviewed the evidence on the utility of CRP as a risk predictor of coronary heart disease and found that although there is an association between elevated CRP levels and coronary heart disease events, there is insufficient evidence that a reduction in CRP levels results in fewer CVD events.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation11\"><span>11</span></a></sup> Additionally, CRP is not currently included in any of the major risk prediction calculators, and the effects of using CRP in addition to traditional CVD risk factors to guide the prescription of statins for reducing CVD risk are uncertain. As such, the USPSTF does not recommend for or against the use of CRP alone as a risk factor in screening to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation12\"><span>12</span></a></sup>&nbsp; In JUPITER, most of the trial participants either also had hypertension (57%) or were smokers (15%)<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10\"><span>10</span></a></sup>&mdash;risk factors the USPSTF prioritized for determining potential suitability for statin therapy. In the recent HOPE-3 trial, there was no difference in the effects of statins among participants with or without elevated CRP levels.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>10-Year Risk of CVD Events</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations to calculate 10-year risk of CVD events.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation13\"><span>13</span></a></sup> In 2013, the ACC/AHA released the Pooled Cohort Equations with the publication of new statin therapy guidelines.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> The calculator derived from these equations takes into account age, sex, race, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status as risk factors in the prediction model and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (heart attack and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest.</p>\r\n<p>This risk calculator has been the source of some controversy, as several investigators not involved with its development have found that it overestimates risk when applied to more contemporary US cohorts, especially those at the lower end of the risk spectrum.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation14\"><span>14</span></a></sup> Although other risk prediction tools are available, they address varying populations, risk factors, and outcomes and have their own limitations. The ACC/AHA risk calculator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations. Other advantages are that it can generate sex- and race-specific risk predictions and that it includes ischemic stroke as an outcome.</p>\r\n<p>Nonmodifiable risk factors for CVD include older age, male sex, and race/ethnicity; however, statin trials have not included persons with only these risk factors. Other risk factors, such as family history of premature coronary artery disease, have not been demonstrated to improve risk prediction in a clinically meaningful way.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation15\"><span>15</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that the calculated 10-year CVD event risk derived from the ACC/AHA risk calculator is heavily influenced by age. For example, 41% of men and 27% of women aged 60 to 69 years without a history of CVD will be found to have a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation16\"><span>16</span></a></sup> Many older adults, particularly those aged 65 to 75 years, may meet the recommended risk threshold for treatment with statins in spite of the absence of dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking. No trial data evaluated statin use among persons in this age group without CVD risk factors; thus, the evidence is insufficient to know whether statin use provides them the same or less benefit than in similarly aged adults with CVD risk factors. Decisions about initiating statin use in this age group should be based on shared decision making between clinicians and patients about the potential benefits and harms. Specific recommendations from other organizations for such individuals are discussed in the \"Recommendations of Others\" section.</p>\r\n<p>Periodic assessment of cardiovascular risk factors from ages 40 to 75 years, including measurement of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels, is required to implement this recommendation. The optimal intervals for cardiovascular risk assessment are uncertain. Based on other guidelines and expert opinion, reasonable options include annual assessment of blood pressure<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation17\"><span>17</span></a></sup> and smoking status<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation18\"><span>18</span></a></sup> and measurement of lipid levels every 5 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> Shorter intervals may be useful for persons whose risk levels are close to those warranting therapy, and longer intervals are appropriate for persons who are not at increased risk and have repeatedly normal levels.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening and Statin Use in Adults Aged 21 to 39 Years</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF systematically searched for evidence on the effect of screening for dyslipidemia in adults aged 21 to 39 years. It found insufficient evidence that screening for dyslipidemia before age 40 years has an effect on either short- or longer-term cardiovascular outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation19\"><span>19</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation20\">20</a></sup></span> The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the effects of screening vs no screening, treatment vs no treatment, or delayed vs earlier treatment in adults in this age group. Thus, the USPSTF recommends neither for nor against screening for dyslipidemia in this age group. A separate recommendation statement also found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation21\"><span>21</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes the rationale for screening for dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years to identify those at risk for the development of early atherosclerosis, including those with familial hypercholesterolemia. Unfortunately, the evidence is lacking in this age group. The USPSTF found 4 trials of statin use for primary prevention that enrolled patients younger than 40 years. However, results were not reported separately for this age group, and it comprised a small part of the overall population.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation19\"><span>19</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation20\">20</a></sup></span> One cohort study compared the effects of statins vs no statins for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation22\"><span>22</span></a></sup> However, the mean age of patients in this study was 44 years. Given the lack of data on the efficacy of screening for or treatment of dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to use their clinical judgment for patients in this age group.</p>\r\n<h3>Statin Use in Adults Aged 40 to 75 Years</h3>\r\n<p>Nineteen RCTs evaluated the effects of statins vs placebo or no statins in adults aged 40 to 75 years without known CVD. Most of the trials, including the recently published HOPE-3 trial,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup> enrolled participants based on an elevated LDL-C level, a diabetes diagnosis, or at least 1 CVD risk factor. Use of low- or moderate-dose statins was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]), ischemic stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]), heart attack (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71]), and a composite cardiovascular outcome (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Among the study populations, the proportion of CVD events prevented (ie, the relative risk reduction) was similar across age, sex, race/ethnicity, lipid level, and other risk factor categories.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> Among trials that stratified participants according to a baseline global cardiovascular risk score, similar relative risk estimates were observed among those classified at a higher vs lower CVD event risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10\"><span>10</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation23\">23</a></sup></span></p>\r\n<p>Given similar relative risk reductions, the absolute magnitude of benefit that an intervention with demonstrated efficacy can have in a specific population directly depends on the incidence of disease over time in that population. In other words, the more likely it is that persons in a certain population will have a heart attack or ischemic stroke, the greater the potential reduction in the number of CVD events with statin use will be in that population. This is one of the fundamental reasons for the distinction between a grade B and C recommendation for the population that presents with dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking and a 10% or greater vs 7.5% to 10% 10-year CVD event risk.</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of other risk factors, adults with an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL may still fall below the risk threshold for statin use for CVD prevention. As noted previously, these persons were generally excluded from the prevention trials evaluating the effects of statin use on health outcomes, because expert opinion strongly favors intervention for these individuals. It is possible that the relative risk reduction in this group is higher than in adults with a lower LDL-C level and that the absolute benefit is greater than would be predicted from a risk calculator.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation24\"><span>24</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Dosage</h3>\r\n<p>As previously noted, available RCTs evaluating statins for the prevention of CVD events largely used low and moderate doses. There were no clear differences in estimates of effect when the trials were stratified according to statin dose (refer to the <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#table\">Table</a> for the drug regimens used in the available trials). The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta-analysis showed that greater degree of LDL-C reductions achieved were associated with proportional reductions in major cardiovascular events.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation25\"><span>25</span></a></sup> However, these analyses were based not on randomized comparisons but the degree of LDL-C reduction achieved. The degree of cholesterol reduction may be attributable, in part, to interindividual variability in response to statins, not just statin dosage.</p>\r\n<p>Limited information is available about use of high-dose statins in a primary prevention population. As such, the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 75 years can only be bounded as small for low- or moderate-dose statins. There may be individual clinical circumstances that warrant consideration of high-dose statin use; decisions about dose should be based on shared decision making between patients and clinicians. However, the most directly applicable body of evidence for patients without a history of CVD demonstrates benefits with use of low- to moderate-dose statins.</p>\r\n<p>Available information about use of high-dose statins in a prevention population comes from the JUPITER trial. The trial found an increased risk of physician-reported incident diabetes with statin use compared with placebo after 2 years of follow-up (3.2% vs 2.4%; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]), which was not reported in trials evaluating use of moderate- or low-dose statins.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10\"><span>10</span></a></sup> Post hoc analysis subsequently suggested that many of the diabetes cases in JUPITER may have occurred in participants who had other risk factors for diabetes at baseline (eg, impaired fasting blood glucose or obesity).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation26\"><span>26</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Summary</h3>\r\n<p>The incidence of CVD events in a population increases linearly with CVD risk level; there is no threshold at which event rates abruptly escalate. As such, any cut point for assessing where the net benefit of statin use shifts from small to moderate for a population requires judgment. Evidence indicates that currently available risk calculators tend to overestimate CVD risk, suggesting that actual benefits may be lower than estimated. Issues to consider include the uncertainty of current risk prediction methods, the overall probability of CVD events occurring in the population, the known and unknown associated harms of statin use, and patient preferences.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 10% or greater 10-year CVD event risk should be offered a low- to moderate-dose statin. Adults with diabetes or dyslipidemia and a 20% or greater 10-year CVD event risk are most likely to benefit from statin use.</p>\r\n<p>Clinicians may selectively offer adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 7.5% to 10% 10-year CVD event risk a low- to moderate-dose statin. Fewer persons in this population will benefit from the intervention, so the decision to initiate use of low- to moderate-dose statins should reflect shared decision making that weighs the potential benefits and harms, the uncertainty about risk prediction, and individual patient preferences, including the acceptability of long-term use of daily medication.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement for Initiating Statin Therapy for Primary Prevention in Adults 76 Years and Older</h3>\r\n<h4><strong><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></strong></h4>\r\n<p>Adults 76 years and older were not included in any of the randomized trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> Thus, understanding of the potential benefits of initiating statin use for primary prevention in this age group is limited.</p>\r\n<h4><strong><em>Potential Harms</em></strong></h4>\r\n<p>Evidence on the potential harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older is very limited. Observational evidence suggests there may be an association between very low cholesterol levels and an increased risk of mortality with advanced age, after adjusting for other risk factors.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation27\"><span>27</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation28\">28</a></sup></span></p>\r\n<h4><strong><em>Current Practice</em></strong></h4>\r\n<p>The most current data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that nearly half (47.6%) of adults 75 years and older in the United States use prescription cholesterol-lowering medications.

Another study using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which did allow for the differentiation of individuals with and without vascular disease (defined as coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease), found that the rate of statin use among adults 80 years and older for the purposes of primary prevention increased from about 9% in 1999&ndash;2000 to 34% in 2011&ndash;2012.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation30\"><span>30</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, as part of the Choosing Wisely campaign, highlighted the use of cholesterol-lowering medications in adults with limited life expectancy (ie, 70 years and, most particularly, 85 years and older) among its \"10 Things Physicians and Patients Should Question\" because of the increased likelihood of an overall unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation31\"><span>31</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made other recommendations relevant to the prevention of CVD in adults, including aspirin use for the prevention of CVD,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation32\"><span>32</span></a></sup> screening for coronary heart disease using electrocardiography,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation33\"><span>33</span></a></sup> use of nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation12\"><span>12</span></a></sup> screening for high blood pressure,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation17\"><span>17</span></a></sup> screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation34\"><span>34</span></a></sup> interventions for tobacco smoking cessation,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation18\"><span>18</span></a></sup> behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation36\"><span>36</span></a></sup> and screening for and management of obesity in adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation36\"><span>36</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Given the lack of studies on screening for and treatment of dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years, more research is needed to examine the efficacy of screening and treatment in this age group.

Such trials should use hard clinical outcomes as endpoints rather than intermediate markers.</p>\r\n<p>Additional research is also warranted on the potential long-term harms of statin therapy, particularly regarding the possible association with increased incidence of diabetes and cataract surgery. Last, research is needed to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults 76 years and older. Currently, there is no trial evidence to evaluate the net benefit of initiating statin therapy in this population.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation replaces the USPSTF 2008 recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in adults. When making a recommendation on a preventive medication, the USPSTF uses the systematic evidence review to determine how to identify persons in the general population for whom the USPSTF can be moderately certain about the balance of benefits and harms of a preventive medication on health outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Accumulating evidence on the role of statins in preventing CVD events across different populations led the USPSTF to reframe its main clinical question &nbsp;from \"which population should be screened for dyslipidemia?\" to \"which population should be prescribed statin therapy?\" Screening for elevated lipid levels is a necessary (but not sufficient) step in the overall assessment of CVD risk to help identify persons who may benefit from statin therapy. In the age range in which statins have been studied for primary prevention, universal screening for elevated lipid levels is required to make this determination. Therefore, the screening framework used in the previous USPSTF recommendation statement is no longer relevant and has been replaced by a preventive medication framework. This recommendation statement focuses on the assessment of overall CVD risk to identify adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who will benefit most from statin use to reduce their risk of experiencing a CVD event. The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the effects of statin use on health outcomes in disease-free adults younger than 40 years. The research plan that guided the evidence review, which served as the foundation of this recommendation statement, did not consider reduction in LDL-C level to be a sufficient surrogate for health outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;Recommendation of Others</h3>\r\n<p>The ACC and AHA recommend statin use in asymptomatic adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg/dL if they also have diabetes (use of moderate- to high-dose statins is recommended, depending on the patient&rsquo;s 10-year CVD event risk) or an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% or greater, as calculated with the Pooled Cohort Equations risk calculator (shared decision making is recommended before initiating use of moderate- to high-dose statins). Instead of treating to a specific LDL-C target, the ACC and AHA recommend fixed-dose statin therapy using either a high-intensity regimen (daily dose reduces LDL-C level by approximately &ge;50%) or a moderate-intensity regimen (daily dose reduces LDL-C level by approximately 30% to &lt;50%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;In response, the Mayo Clinic established a task force, which generally provides consistent recommendations, although it emphasizes lifestyle modifications rather than statin therapy in adults 40 years and older who have an LDL-C level less than 100 mg/dL or are sufficiently motivated to reduce their CVD event risk to less than 7.5%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation43\">43</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statin therapy combined with health behavior modification in men 40 years and older and women 50 years and older without CVD risk factors and in adults of any age with CVD risk factors who also have a 20% or greater 10-year CVD event risk or an LDL-C level of 135 to 190 mg/dL and a 10% to 20% CVD event risk (based on the Framingham risk score). Statin therapy in adults with a Framingham risk score of less than 10% is reserved for those with genetic hypercholesterolemia or an LDL-C level of 193 mg/dL or greater. The treatment strategy is treatment-to-target rather than by therapy dose (eg, &ge;50% reduction in LDL-C level).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation44\">44</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that statin therapy (specifically, atorvastatin [20 mg]) for the primary prevention of CVD events be offered to adults 40 years and older with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD event risk, as estimated by the QRISK2 assessment tool. Before offering statin therapy, clinicians should discuss the benefits of lifestyle modification and optimize the management of all other modifiable CVD risk factors.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation45\">45</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The median duration of follow-up was 3 years, and 3 trials were stopped early because of observed benefits in the intervention group.

In general, statin therapy was statistically significantly associated with a reduced incidence of composite CVD outcomes compared with placebo; pooled analysis of 13 trials found an RR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78) after 1 to 6 years. Fifteen trials reported on all-cause mortality after 1 to 6 years, and pooled analysis estimated an RR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93). Although this estimate was heavily influenced by the JUPITER, HOPE-3, and ASCOT-LLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial&mdash;Lipid Lowering Arm) trials<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10\"><span>10</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation40\">40</a></sup></span> because of their large sample sizes, the estimate was robust in multiple sensitivity analyses.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Ten trials reported on cardiovascular mortality. Pooled analysis found an RR of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88) after 2 to 6 years, although statistical heterogeneity was present and there was some inconsistency in the individual trials.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> Twelve trials provided information about fatal and nonfatal MI. Results were mixed, but most large trials found that statin use led to a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of any MI; the pooled RR after 2 to 6 years of follow-up was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> Thirteen trials reported on the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke. After 6 months to 6 years of follow-up, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of any stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Across these outcomes, benefits appeared consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups, including patients without severe dyslipidemia at baseline.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> Given similar relative risk estimates across a population, the absolute degree of benefit will be greatest in persons with higher baseline risk of experiencing a CVD event.</p>\r\n<p>Fifteen trials used fixed-dose statin therapy, of which the majority evaluated moderate doses; there were no clear differences in estimates when trials were stratified according to dose. Two trials directly compared different statin doses but were underpowered to draw reliable conclusions about clinical outcomes. No studies were identified that directly compared treatment with statins titrated to attain target cholesterol levels vs fixed-dose or other strategies. Although 3 trials used high-dose statin therapy, only 1 (JUPITER) investigated hard clinical outcomes (eg, fatal or nonfatal MI or CVD mortality).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10\">10</a></sup></span> Thus, direct evidence on whether different doses of statin therapy or treatment-to-target strategies affect clinical outcomes is extremely limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Statin Use</h3>\r\n<p>In randomized trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD, statin therapy was not associated with an increased risk of withdrawal because of adverse events compared with placebo, and there were no statistically significant differences in the risk of experiencing any serious adverse event. The trials also found no evidence of an increase in cancer or elevated aminotransferase levels with statin use.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence on the association between statin use and adverse cognitive effects is very limited, but no clear increase in risk was observed.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> A systematic review of RCTs and observational studies on the effects of statin use for any indication on cognition found no statistically significant differences in performance scores on tests of attention, visual perception, motor and processing speed, memory, cognitive performance, or executive function, and no effect on the incidence of Alzheimer disease or dementia.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation7\"><span>7</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Although muscle pain, soreness, or weakness are commonly reported with statin use, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for myalgia (7 trials; pooled RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16]), myopathy (3 trials; pooled RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.48 to 2.47]), or rhabdomyolysis (4 trials; pooled RR, 1.57 [95% CI, 0.41 to 5.99]), although the confidence intervals for the latter 2 conditions were very wide because of a low number of reported events.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Data from 5 RCTs and 2 observational studies provided evidence on the potential association between statin use and diabetes incidence. Pooled analysis of the RCTs demonstrated no association between statin use and increased risk of diabetes compared with placebo (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.20]);<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> however, the only trial that evaluated a high-dose statin (JUPITER) reported a statistically significant increased risk of diabetes with statin use.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10\"><span>10</span></a></sup> In post hoc stratified analysis, participants with 1 or more risk factors for diabetes (eg, obesity or the metabolic syndrome) were at higher risk of developing diabetes than those without such factors (hazard ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.54] vs 0.99 [95% CI, 0.45 to 2.21]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation26\"><span>26</span></a></sup> Observational studies also reported mixed findings; a UK case-control study found no association with statin use,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation41\"><span>41</span></a></sup> but an analysis from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative noted an increased diabetes risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.38 to 1.59]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation42\"><span>42</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The HOPE-3 trial found that statin use was associated with increased risk of cataract surgery, which was unanticipated and not a predetermined outcome of the trial (3.8% vs 3.1%; RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.49]). No other trials noted this outcome.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>No direct evidence from RCTs is available to guide the choice of a specific CVD risk threshold for statin use. However, in the available trials of statin use among adults at increased risk of CVD but without a history of CVD events, benefits have been generally consistent across different clinical and demographic subgroups (even among adults without marked dyslipidemia). As such, the likelihood that patients will benefit from statin use is directly associated with their absolute baseline risk of experiencing a CVD event.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD event risk should be offered a low- to moderate-dose statin. In this population, the higher the underlying 10-year CVD event risk, the greater the likelihood of benefit from statin use. Because the absolute underlying risk is lower, fewer adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 7.5% to 10% 10-year CVD event risk will benefit from statin use. As such, any decision to initiate use of low- to moderate-dose statins in this population should involve shared decision making that weighs the potential benefits and harms and the uncertainty surrounding individual CVD risk prediction. It should also take into consideration the personal preferences of each patient, including the acceptability of long-term use of daily medication.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older without a history of CVD cannot be determined.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from December 22, 2015, to January 25, 2016. Some comments asked why the USPSTF recommended evaluation of CVD risk factors in addition to the use of a risk calculator or why it used different cut points compared with the ACC/AHA guidelines. In response, the USPSTF clarified its rationale, noting that trial participants generally had 1 or more CVD risk factors and were not recruited based on any particular calculated risk score or cut point. Reliance on a risk calculator such as the Pooled Cohort Equations alone as a basis for prevention may be problematic, given its possible overestimation of risk in some populations. As such, the USPSTF clarified that the benefits of statin use may be linear according to a patient&rsquo;s absolute risk level, and any cut points used are only population estimates of benefits. Clinicians should encourage individualized decision making regarding statin use in their patients, given the known potential benefits and harms.</p>\r\n<p>A few comments requested clarification on the I statement regarding statin use among adults 76 years and older. The USPSTF clarified that the I statement pertains to initiating statin use for primary prevention in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin. Some comments requested clarification regarding the optimal dose of statins. The USPSTF clarified that its recommendation for use of low- to moderate-dose statins is based on the fact that most of the trials were primarily of low to moderate doses, and there were no clear differences in estimates of benefit when trials were stratified according to dose.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the USPSTF clarified that these recommendations do not pertain to adults with very high CVD risk, such as those with familial hypercholesterolemia or an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL, since they were excluded from primary prevention trials. These persons should be screened and treated in accordance to clinical judgment for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Last, some comments inquired about the use of other factors for CVD risk assessment. The USPSTF clarified that CRP level, coronary artery calcium score, ankle-brachial index, and other factors for CVD risk assessment are addressed in other USPSTF recommendations (available at <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations </span></strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation replaces the USPSTF 2008 recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in adults.

Unlike other infections for which screening is recommended, HSV infection may not have a long asymptomatic period during which screening, early identification, and treatment may alter its course. Antiviral medications may provide symptomatic relief from outbreaks; however, these medications do not cure HSV infection. Although vertical transmission of HSV can occur between an infected pregnant woman and her infant during vaginal delivery, interventions can help reduce transmission. Neonatal herpes infection, while uncommon, can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>In the past, most cases of genital herpes in the United States have been caused by infection with HSV-2. Adequate evidence suggests that the most widely used, currently available serologic screening test for HSV-2 approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is not suitable for population-based screening, based on its low specificity, the lack of widely available confirmatory testing, and its high false-positive rate. Rates of genital herpes due to HSV-1 infection in the United States may be increasing.

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Genital herpes is an STI caused by 2 related viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2. In adolescents and adults, genital infection often results in outbreaks of blisters (vesicles) in the area in and around the genitals and rectum. These blisters break and leave sores (ulcers) that are often painful. The first outbreak of genital herpes is usually the most painful and may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms, including fever, body aches, and swollen glands. Among persons who have a symptomatic first outbreak, 70% to 90% will have at least 1 more symptomatic outbreak within the first year, with an average of 4 outbreaks.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the initial outbreak. Although the risk of transmission is higher during a symptomatic outbreak, persons with genital herpes can spread the infection to sexual partners even when they are asymptomatic. Studies suggest that up to 85% of persons who are found to be infected with HSV-2 and who report no prior symptoms of genital herpes have a symptomatic outbreak within 6 months of being tested. According to some experts, persons who receive education about genital herpes may be more likely to recognize and report its symptoms. If this is true, some persons who are considered &ldquo;asymptomatic&rdquo; may have actually experienced symptoms but not identified them as genital herpes.</p>\r\n<p>There is currently no cure for genital herpes; once infection has occurred, the virus remains in a person for life. For this reason, the prevalence of infection increases with age. Data from the 2005&ndash;2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that the prevalence of HSV-2 infection ranged from 1.2% in adolescents aged 14 to 19 years to 25.6% in adults aged 40 to 49 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Overall, 15.7% of persons aged 14 to 49 years in the United States tested positive for HSV-2 infection between 2005 and 2010.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;These estimates, however, should be interpreted with caution; because of a lack of confirmatory testing, these data may overestimate the prevalence of HSV-2 infection. These data also may underestimate the overall prevalence of genital herpes, as they do not account for herpes infection caused by HSV-1. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, women were almost twice as likely to be infected with HSV-2 as men (20.9% vs 11.5%), in part because of anatomical factors that predispose women to infection.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation11\">11</a></sup>&nbsp;Rates of HSV-2 infection also vary by race/ethnicity and geographical region and are higher in men who have sex with men.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The herpes simplex virus may be transmitted from mother to infant during vaginal delivery.

Using a clinical laboratory system, that study found 76 cases of neonatal HSV infection among approximately 571,000 infants&mdash;an estimated incidence rate of 13.3 cases per 100,000 live births.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;The study also found that of the 72% of cases for which HSV typing was done, infections were almost equally caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 (28 vs 27 cases).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;Incidence rates are thought to vary by geographic region and race/ethnicity.

Western blot is considered to be the gold standard for the serologic diagnosis of herpes. Western blot test results can be obtained by sending a blood sample to a single research laboratory (University of Washington Clinical Virology Laboratory); however, it is not widely available as a screening or confirmatory test for persons who screen positive for HSV-2 on one of the less-specific, commercially available serologic tests. No studies have examined the screening accuracy of serologic HSV tests in pregnant women. Serologic HSV tests may be clinically useful for persons with persistent undiagnosed genital symptoms and in other diagnostic settings.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Currently, there is no cure for genital HSV infection. Antiviral medications are generally used for the management of symptomatic outbreaks and for prevention in patients with a history of frequent symptomatic outbreaks. In studies, many persons identified with asymptomatic genital herpes (ie, they have been infected with HSV-2 and have never experienced symptoms) have a symptomatic outbreak within 6 months of testing. The increasing percentage of genital herpes cases caused by HSV-1 also limits the potential benefit of serologic screening in asymptomatic persons. While HSV-1 infection can be detected through serologic tests, these tests cannot determine the site of HSV infection. Since HSV-1 can cause both oral and genital herpes infections, and oral herpes infection is very common, serologic tests for HSV-1 cannot be used to screen for asymptomatic genital herpes infection. The evidence is inadequate to determine if suppressive antiviral therapy reduces transmission of genital HSV infection between serodiscordant couples with an asymptomatic partner.</p>\r\n<p>Pregnant adolescents and women with new or known history of genital HSV infection should be carefully observed during pregnancy. To reduce the chance of HSV transmission to the infant during delivery, women with active genital HSV lesions at the time of birth are usually offered the option of cesarean delivery. No studies have examined the effectiveness of antiviral therapy to decrease the risk for HSV transmission to pregnant women by an infected partner.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Serologic screening in asymptomatic persons will likely result in a large number of false-positive results. Given the limitations of currently available tests, 1 of 2 positive results may be false. Given the test characteristics of the most widely used serologic screening test for HSV-2 and a population infection prevalence of 15%, screening 10,000 persons would result in approximately 1485 true-positive and 1445 false-positive results. Confirmatory testing is not currently widely available and is only performed at a single research laboratory. There are social and emotional harms of receiving a false-positive result, in addition to the potential harms of unnecessary treatment with preventive antiviral medications.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation23\">23</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;However, antiviral medications are generally considered to have few harms in nonpregnant adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/genital-herpes-screening1#citation21\">21</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Based on the natural history of HSV infection, its epidemiology, and the available evidence on the accuracy of serologic screening tests, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential benefits and harms and conclude with moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits of serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 2 to August 29, 2016. The USPSTF reviewed and considered all comments received during this period. Several comments supported the USPSTF's analysis and conclusions; some comments noted that the recommendation is consistent with current clinical practice and advice from other organizations, including the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). A few comments expressed concern that persons with asymptomatic genital herpes infection can (unknowingly) transmit the infection to sexual partners. While the USPSTF understands this concern, given the current lack of accurate, widely available serologic screening tests and the expected high rate of false-positive results that would occur with widespread screening in asymptomatic persons, the USPSTF continues to recommend against routine serologic screening in asymptomatic adolescents and adults. In addition, the USPSTF clarified its language about HSV-1 infection, noting that while HSV-1 infection can be identified by serologic tests, the tests cannot determine if the site of infection is oral or genital.</p>",

The newer studies are more subject to design issues than the older ones, which had fewer design flaws.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Case-control studies have the potential for selection and recall bias, both of which can reduce the observed effect of folic acid supplementation on neural tube defects. Another issue with all study designs is the relative rarity of the outcome and the challenge of adequately powering studies to determine benefits. Another potential explanation for the findings is that the majority of cases of neural tube defects due to folate deficiency have now been prevented, and subsequent cases result from a different etiology. Despite this possible rationale, evidence indicates that most women are not consuming fortified foods at the level needed for optimal benefit. Inadequate folate intake continues to leave nearly one-fourth of the US population with suboptimal red blood cell folate concentration.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation9\">9</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Three fair-quality case-control studies (n = 11,154) examined the effects of folic acid supplementation by race/ethnicity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation18\">18-20</a></sup>&nbsp;One study found that folic acid supplementation may be less protective among Hispanic women compared with white or black women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;A second study found a statistically nonsignificant increased risk of neural tube defects with supplementation among Hispanic women (OR adjusted for consistent users vs nonusers, 2.20 [95% CI, 0.98 to 4.92]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation19\">19</a></sup>.

Evidence is adequate that the harms to the mother or infant from folic acid supplementation taken at the usual doses are no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its 2009 recommendation that all women who are planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 &micro;g) of folic acid.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation8\">8</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Genetic predisposition and environmental influences are thought to contribute to neural tube defects. These environmental influences are being investigated. An important environmental influence is the consumption of folate. The mechanism of action of folate in the prevention of neural tube defects is unknown. Folate acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of nucleic acids and the metabolism of amino acids. An important function of folate is its role in single-carbon transfers, which are important in methylation reactions and in purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Folate is necessary for the regulation of DNA synthesis and function; reduced concentrations of folate may limit the number of methyl groups available for DNA replication and methylation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation7\">7</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation10\">10</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence suggests that mutation in the&nbsp;<em>MTHFR</em>&nbsp;gene, which encodes the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, is a risk factor for neural tube defects. This enzyme regulates folate and homocysteine levels. Persons who have this gene mutation have decreased folate levels, which reduces the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and may increase the risk of neural tube defects.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/folic-acid-for-the-prevention-of-neural-tube-defects-preventive-medication#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Folic acid consumption may help diminish the effects of the gene mutation.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 10 to June 6, 2016. Some comments requested a more detailed definition of &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; folic acid. In response, the USPSTF added information about tolerable upper intake levels for folic acid. Other comments suggested emphasizing that many women do not meet daily recommended amounts of folic acid and adding language on the potential harms of folic acid supplementation. The USPSTF added language about the harms of supplementation and the difficulty of consuming enough folic acid from food alone.</p>",

Severe OSA is associated with increased all-cause mortality;<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;however, the role OSA plays in increasing overall mortality, independent from other risk factors (older age, higher body mass index [BMI], and other cardiovascular risk factors), is less clear. In addition to mortality, other adverse health outcomes associated with untreated OSA include cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular events, diabetes, cognitive impairment, decreased quality of life, and motor vehicle crashes.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence on the use of validated screening questionnaires in asymptomatic adults (or adults with unrecognized symptoms) to accurately identify who will benefit from further testing for OSA is inadequate. The USPSTF identified this as a critical gap in the evidence.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefit of screening for OSA in asymptomatic populations. The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the effect of screening for OSA on health outcomes. The USPSTF found at least adequate evidence that treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mandibular advancement devices (MADs) can improve intermediate outcomes (eg, the apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score, and blood pressure) in populations referred for treatment. However, the applicability of this evidence to screen-detected populations is limited. The adequacy of the evidence varies based on the type of intervention and the reported intermediate outcomes. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the link between change in the intermediate outcome (eg, AHI) and reduction in the health outcome (eg, mortality). The USPSTF found evidence that treatment with CPAP can improve general and sleep-related quality of life in populations referred for treatment, but the applicability of this evidence to screen-detected populations is unknown. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on whether treatment with CPAP or MADs improves other health outcomes (mortality, cognitive impairment, motor vehicle crashes, and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events). The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the effect of treatment with various surgical procedures in improving intermediate or health outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the direct harms of screening for OSA. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of treatment of OSA with CPAP and MADs are small. Reported harms include oral or nasal dryness; eye or skin irritation; rash; epistaxis; pain; excess salivation; and oral mucosal, dental, and jaw symptoms. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of surgical treatment of OSA.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults. Evidence on screening tools to accurately detect persons in asymptomatic populations who should receive further testing and treatment of subsequently diagnosed OSA to improve health outcomes is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults (18 years and older). It also applies to adults with unrecognized symptoms of OSA. This includes persons who are not aware of their symptoms or do not report symptoms as being a concern to their clinician. This recommendation does not apply to persons presenting with symptoms (e.g., snoring, witnessed apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood changes, or gasping or choking at night) or concerns about OSA, persons who have been referred for evaluation or treatment of suspected OSA, or persons who have acute conditions that could trigger the onset of OSA (e.g., stroke). Care of these persons should be managed as clinically appropriate. This recommendation also does not apply to children, adolescents, or pregnant women.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Based on data from the 1990s, the estimated prevalence of OSA in the United States is 10% for mild OSA and 3.8% to 6.5% for moderate to severe OSA.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1-3</a></sup>&nbsp;Current prevalence may be higher, given the increasing prevalence of obesity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Extrapolation from long-term follow-up data from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study (1988&ndash;1994 to 2007&ndash;2010) results in an estimated prevalence of 16% for mild OSA and 10% for moderate to severe OSA.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The prevalence of severe OSA in asymptomatic persons is unknown. In the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, approximately 6% of adults with no or mild OSA progressed to moderate to severe OSA over 4 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation7\">7</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Risk factors associated with OSA include male sex, older age (40 to 70 years), postmenopausal status, higher BMI, and craniofacial and upper airway abnormalities. The evidence on other risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol and sedative use, and nasal congestion, is sparse or mixed.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Observational studies have reported an association between severe OSA and mortality risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;In theory, screening for OSA could improve mortality by identifying OSA early and providing treatment before it can adversely influence mortality. Although studies generally show that treatment of OSA with CPAP and MADs improves intermediate outcomes, such as AHI and ESS score, there is a lack of studies demonstrating that change in AHI or ESS score improves health outcomes, and no well-controlled trials have demonstrated an improvement in mortality with treatment of OSA.</p>\r\n<p>In trials reviewed by the USPSTF, treatment with CPAP effectively reduced AHI to normal (&lt;5) or near-normal (&lt;10) levels. Treatment with MADs showed more modest improvements in AHI. Treatment with either CPAP or MADs improved ESS scores by approximately 2 points, and trials evaluating treatment with CPAP also found reductions in blood pressure. However, the clinical significance of these small reductions is unclear. Of note, trials that evaluated treatment with CPAP or MADs were primarily conducted in referred or sleep clinic patients, not screen-detected patients from primary care settings.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Direct evidence on the harms of screening for OSA is lacking. Commonly reported harms of treatment with CPAP include oral or nasal dryness, eye or skin irritation, rash, epistaxis, and pain.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;An estimated 14% to 32% of patients discontinue treatment with CPAP over 4 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup>Commonly reported harms of treatment with MADs include oral mucosal, dental, or jaw symptoms, such as mucosal or dental pain, discomfort or tenderness, mucosal erosions, and jaw or temporomandibular joint pain or discomfort. Less common harms include oral dryness and excess salivation. Limited study data suggest that 7% of patients discontinue treatment with MADs because of harms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Most primary care clinicians do not routinely screen for OSA.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;According to a practice-based research network study of 44 practices, only 20% of patients with sleep-related symptoms who regularly visit a primary care clinician spontaneously reported their symptoms to their clinician.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;Some potential barriers to screening cited by clinicians include being unsure about how to identify and diagnose OSA, uncertainty regarding which type of sleep monitors are best for the diagnosis of OSA, and how to follow up patients who have been diagnosed with OSA.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Potential screening questionnaires and clinical prediction tools include the ESS, STOP Questionnaire (Snoring, Tiredness, Observed Apnea, High Blood Pressure), STOP-Bang Questionnaire (STOP Questionnaire plus BMI, Age, Neck Circumference, and Gender), Berlin Questionnaire, Wisconsin Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multivariable Apnea Prediction (MVAP) tool. However, none of these instruments have been adequately validated in a primary care setting.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>The identification of valid and reliable clinical prediction tools that could accurately determine which asymptomatic persons (or persons with unrecognized symptoms) would benefit from further evaluation and testing for OSA is needed. In addition, studies that evaluate the effect of OSA treatments or interventions on health outcomes (eg, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular events, motor vehicle crashes, and cognitive impairment) that are adequately powered and have an appropriate length of follow-up are needed. Studies are also needed to evaluate whether improvement in AHI (for mild to severe OSA) leads to improvement in health outcomes. These represent critical gaps in the current evidence base. The USPSTF has identified the need for further research on the effect on health outcomes of screening for OSA among asymptomatic persons in the general population, as well as the role of sleepiness in determining health outcomes. More data on the natural history of mild OSA are also needed, in particular the rates of progression from mild to severe OSA, the length of duration before progression, and the magnitude of benefit if OSA is identified and treated earlier.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians&rsquo; recommendation is consistent with that of the USPSTF and concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;The American College of Physicians recommends conducting a sleep study for patients with unexplained daytime sleepiness (grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

In addition, this single study has not been externally validated and was found to have moderate risk of bias due to missing data, attrition bias, and spectrum bias.</p>\r\n<p>Two studies evaluated the MVAP tool in community or primary care settings. Although both studies were published by the same research group, one study was conducted in Medicare patients with daytime sleepiness (n=452),<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;while the other was conducted in patients with hypertension (n=250) visiting internal medicine practices (US Department of Veterans Affairs medical center system and a university-based hypertension clinic).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;Among the Medicare patients with daytime sleepiness, the MVAP tool had a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 64.4% to predict severe OSAS (defined in the study as an AHI &ge;30 and ESS score &gt;10).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;Among patients with hypertension, the MVAP tool had a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 43.9% to predict severe OSAS.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;When unattended, in-home portable sleep monitor testing was added, the sensitivity of the MVAP tool to predict severe OSAS increased to 90.9% and specificity increased to 75.7%;<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;in the study of Medicare patients, while sensitivity decreased to 88.2%, specificity increased to 71.6% among patients with hypertension.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;The 2 studies that evaluated the MVAP tool were conducted in populations that had a high prevalence of OSAS (and thus were more likely to be symptomatic) and a high risk of spectrum bias (ie, the study population does not represent the general primary care population).</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF also evaluated the evidence on the accuracy of diagnostic tests for OSA. In particular, it evaluated the evidence on the various types of portable sleep monitors compared with polysomnography. Evidence was obtained from 2 systematic reviews and 19 additional studies.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Most studies evaluated type III and type IV portable monitors. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 3 studies (n=160) on type II portable monitors, 21 studies (n=1691) on type III portable monitors, and 84 studies (n=8773) on type IV portable monitors.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;None of the studies were conducted in screen-detected populations, and most were conducted in referral populations being evaluated for suspected OSA. Studies were conducted in a variety of settings (home or laboratory) and used a variety of AHI cutpoints, which were not always well reported.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>The overall quality of evidence on type II and type IV portable monitors was found to be fair, while the overall quality of evidence on type III portable monitors was found to be good. A broad range of sensitivity and specificity was reported across multiple AHI cutpoints. Generally, studies on type II and type III portable monitors reported moderate to high sensitivity and specificity, whereas sensitivity and specificity of type IV portable monitors was highly variable and inconsistent (more information is available in Table 5 of the full evidence report<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>). Overall, consistent with findings from other systematic reviews, type III and type IV portable monitors seem to be generally accurate in diagnosing OSA but have a wide and variable bias in estimating actual AHI<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;in patients being evaluated for suspected OSA. It is unclear how these portable sleep monitors would perform in asymptomatic, screen-detected persons.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the effect of screening for OSA on health outcomes, such as mortality, quality of life, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The USPSTF did identify and review studies on the effect of treatment on intermediate outcomes (eg, AHI, ESS score, and blood pressure) and health outcomes (eg, mortality, quality of life, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events).</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 76 good- to fair-quality treatment trials that described the effect of various interventions on intermediate outcomes, including AHI, ESS score, and blood pressure.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The most evidence was available on CPAP and found that compared with sham intervention, CPAP reduced AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], -33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 studies; n=543), ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 studies; n=2721), and blood pressure (diurnal systolic blood pressure WMD, -2.4 [95% CI, -3.9 to -0.9] and diurnal diastolic blood pressure WMD, -1.3 [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 studies; n=1190).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Less evidence was available on the effect of treatment with MADs on intermediate outcomes. Meta-analysis found that compared with sham intervention, MADs reduced AHI (WMD, -12.6 [95% CI, -15.5 to -9.7]; 6 studies; n=307) and ESS score (WMD, -1.5 [95% CI, -2.8 to -0.2]; 5 studies; n=267) but not blood pressure. Five studies evaluated treatment with upper airway surgery; each evaluated a different surgical technique. Findings on AHI were inconsistent, and no statistically significant improvements in ESS score or blood pressure were found. Although studies generally showed that treatment with CPAP reduced AHI to near-normal levels, treatment with MADs resulted in more modest reductions, and the clinical significance of the small reductions in ESS score is uncertain. Small reductions in blood pressure are associated with cardiovascular disease benefits at the population level, but no evidence of this benefit was seen in these studies. Further, given that most of the trials were conducted in referred or sleep clinic patients, the applicability of this evidence to a screen-detected population is limited.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 50 fair- to good-quality trials that evaluated the effect of various treatments or interventions on health outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The most evidence was available on CPAP; however, the USPSTF found the evidence on most outcomes to be inadequate because of short length of follow-up and underpowered studies (ie, too few events observed). Thirty-one trials (n=2673) reported on the effect of treatment with CPAP on mortality; most trials (29/31) followed up participants for only 12 weeks or less, and most trials (27/31) reported no deaths in either study group.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Twelve trials reported on cognitive function; however, they used heterogeneous outcome measures, which made comparison difficult, and results were generally inconsistent. Five trials (n=1529) reported on incidence of myocardial infarction. Most trials (4/5) followed up participants for less than 1 year, and when combined, only reported 1 death (in the control group). Few trials reported on motor vehicle crashes, cerebrovascular events, or heart failure.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Evidence was available on general and sleep-related quality of life, and there were small but statistically significant improvements in sleep-related quality-of-life scores, but the clinical significance of these improvements is unclear. Importantly, given the characteristics of included study participants (who were from sleep clinics or referral populations, were largely symptomatic, and had daytime sleepiness and more severe OSA), the applicability of this evidence to an asymptomatic, screen-detected population is questionable. Few studies reported on the effect of treatment with MADs (6 studies; n=510) or upper airway surgery (4 studies; n=187) on any health outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the consistent observational findings of an association between severe OSA and increased mortality, the USPSTF identified no studies that reported on change in AHI and associated change in mortality. Thus, it is unclear whether treatments that improve AHI would also improve mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified no studies that directly evaluated the harms of screening for OSA. A subset of studies that evaluated the effectiveness of various OSA treatments also reported on harms of treatment. Nine studies (n=1759) reported on harms of treatment with CPAP. Follow-up in these studies was generally from 8 to 12 weeks, and most participants were men, with a mean age range of 42 to 61 years, who were overweight or obese (mean BMI, 27 to 39 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]). Overall, 2% to 47% of trial participants reported any adverse effects from treatment with CPAP, including oral or nasal dryness, eye or skin irritation, rash, epistaxis, and pain.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Eight trials (n=443) reported on harms of treatment with MADs. Follow-up in these studies was generally from 4 to 6 weeks. In 7 trials, 17% to 74% of participants reported oral mucosal, dental, or jaw symptoms, compared with 0% to 17% of participants in comparator groups. In 4 studies, 5% to 33% of participants reported oral dryness, compared with 0% to 3% in control groups, and in 3 studies, 23% to 68% of participants reported excessive salivation, compared with 0% to 3% in comparator groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Four trials (n=205) reported harms of treatment with upper airway surgery; 1% to 81% of participants reported any harms, which included pain, postoperative bleeding, difficulty speaking and swallowing, change in vocal quality, hematomas, ulcerations, infections, and temporary nasal regurgitation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults or adults with unrecognized symptoms. No studies directly evaluated the benefits or harms of screening for OSA. Few studies evaluated the accuracy of specific screening tools to identify persons at high risk for OSA who could benefit from further testing. Although numerous studies evaluated the effectiveness of treatment with CPAP or MADs to improve intermediate outcomes (eg, AHI, ESS score, or blood pressure) in patients already receiving care or referred for care at a sleep clinic, the clinical significance of these changes and the applicability of this evidence to asymptomatic, screen-detected populations are unclear. Further, evidence is insufficient to determine whether treatment of screen-detected, asymptomatic or unrecognized OSA improves final health outcomes (eg, mortality or cardiovascular events) or whether improving intermediate outcomes (eg, AHI or ESS score) would improve these final health outcomes. Studies that evaluated the effect of treatment with CPAP or MADs on mortality were either underpowered or of too short duration to detect a difference between treated and untreated groups, and no studies reported on whether change in AHI or ESS score affects mortality. Fewer studies reported on the harms of treatment. Overall, the USPSTF was unable to determine the magnitude of the benefits or harms of screening for OSA or whether there is a net benefit or harm to screening in asymptomatic adults or adults with unrecognized symptoms.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>According to observational studies, severe untreated OSA has been found to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Other adverse outcomes that have been reported include increased risk of motor vehicle and other crashes; cognitive impairment; lost work days, work disability, and impaired work performance; and decreased quality of life.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;However, it is unclear what role OSA plays in causing these adverse outcomes, independent from other associated factors such as obesity, older age, hypertension, and general lifestyle. One hypothesis is that OSA leads to chronic disturbances in gas exchange, sympathetic nervous system arousal, and fragmented sleep.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 14 to July 11, 2016. Some comments expressed concern that the definition of \"asymptomatic\" is unclear, did not agree that an asymptomatic population is the same as persons with unrecognized symptoms, or expressed concern that many symptomatic patients do not report symptoms to their health care professional. The USPSTF discussed its definitional approach extensively when creating the research plan. In the research plan, the USPSTF established that persons without symptoms or with unrecognized symptoms are the population of interest in which to identify potentially unrecognized OSA. In response to comments, the USPSTF described common symptoms of OSA and defined what is meant by persons with unrecognized symptoms. Other comments suggested that a number of key studies were omitted that link OSA treatment to improved health outcomes. The USPSTF examined these studies and found they were either already included in the review, did not meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, or were otherwise outside the scope of the review. A few comments suggested that persons who work in safety-sensitive transportation occupations (eg, truck drivers or rail operators) have unique testing needs. Clinicians seeking information on testing persons who work in these occupations can consult the appropriate agency&rsquo;s guidelines. The US Department of Transportation recently sought public input related to the evaluation of moderate to severe OSA among persons with these occupations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults-screening#citation19\">19</a></sup></p>",

These conditions include but are not limited to malignant diseases, such as ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and cervical cancer; infectious diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, genital warts, genital herpes, trichomoniasis, and pelvic inflammatory disease; and other benign conditions, such as cervical polyps, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, dysfunction of the pelvic wall and floor, and uterine fibroids. Pelvic examination is a common part of the physical examination; in 2012, 44.2 million pelvic examinations were performed in the United States.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Although it is a common part of the physical examination, it is unclear whether performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women has a significant effect on disease morbidity and mortality.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made separate recommendations on screening for cervical cancer,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;gonorrhea,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;and chlamydia<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;using tests that are often performed during a pelvic examination (e.g., Pap smear, human papillomavirus test, and nucleic acid amplification tests); in this recommendation statement, the USPSTF seeks to understand the utility of performing screening pelvic examinations for other gynecologic conditions. Although the USPSTF sought evidence on the effectiveness of using pelvic examination to screen for all asymptomatic gynecologic conditions other than cervical cancer, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, it was only able to identify limited evidence on its accuracy to detect ovarian cancer, bacterial vaginosis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The pelvic examination may include any of the following components, alone or in combination: assessment of the external genitalia, internal speculum examination, bimanual palpation, and rectovaginal examination. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of pelvic examination to detect a range of gynecologic conditions. Limited evidence from studies evaluating the use of screening pelvic examination alone for ovarian cancer detection generally reported low positive predictive values (0% to 3.6%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Very few studies on screening for other gynecologic conditions with pelvic examination alone have been conducted,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;and the USPSTF found that these studies have limited generalizability to the current population of asymptomatic women seen in primary care settings in the United States.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of screening for a range of gynecologic conditions with pelvic examination. No studies were identified that evaluated the benefit of screening with pelvic examination on all-cause mortality, disease-specific morbidity or mortality, or quality of life.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for a range of gynecologic conditions with pelvic examination. A few studies reported on false-positive rates for ovarian cancer, ranging from 1.2% to 8.6%, and false-negative rates, ranging from 0% to 100%. Among women who had abnormal findings on pelvic examination, 5% to 36% went on to have surgery.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Very few studies reported false-positive and false-negative rates for other gynecologic conditions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;No studies quantified the amount of anxiety associated with screening pelvic examinations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women for the early detection and treatment of a range of gynecologic conditions. Evidence is lacking and of poor quality, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 18 years and older who are not at increased risk for any specific gynecologic conditions, such as ovarian or cervical cancer. It does not apply to pregnant women or adolescents.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Numerous gynecologic conditions may be detected during a screening pelvic examination. These include malignant diseases, such as ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and cervical cancer; infectious diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, genital warts, genital herpes, trichomoniasis, and pelvic inflammatory disease; and other benign conditions, such as cervical polyps, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, dysfunction of the pelvic wall and floor, and uterine fibroids.</p>\r\n<p>The accuracy of detecting and the benefit of treating some of these conditions early, while women are asymptomatic, is unknown. No studies evaluated the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment of screen-detected, asymptomatic gynecologic conditions compared with the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic gynecologic conditions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;It is also unknown whether performing screening pelvic examinations more frequently than every 3 to 5 years (the recommended screening interval for cervical cancer) is beneficial. Although it is common practice to perform a pelvic examination as part of an annual physical examination, the benefit of performing screening pelvic examinations at this interval is unclear. The benefit of using pelvic examination alone to screen for gynecologic conditions other than cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia is also unknown.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of screening with pelvic examination. Harms reported in studies included false-positive and false-negative results. Available evidence reports false-positive rates for ovarian cancer of 1.2% to 8.6% and false-negative rates of 0% to 100%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Pelvic examination screening also could result in unnecessary diagnostic workup and treatment. In particular, there is a concern for potential invasive diagnostic procedures and treatment of ovarian cancer (such as surgery) that could result from evaluating abnormal findings on pelvic examination. In the reviewed studies, approximately 5% to 36% of women who had abnormal pelvic examination findings went on to have surgery.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The potential association between urinary tract infections and pelvic examinations was explored in a single study with inconclusive results.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Additional theoretical harms of pelvic examination include psychological harms (anxiety), pain and discomfort from the examination, and the potential for these harms to serve as a barrier for women to receive medical care.</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benefits and harms of using pelvic examination to screen for asymptomatic gynecologic conditions, clinicians are encouraged to consider the patient&rsquo;s risk factors for various gynecologic conditions and the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences, and engage in shared decisionmaking with the patient to determine whether to perform a pelvic examination.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 44.2 million pelvic examinations were performed in 2012.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;In a 2010&ndash;2011 nationally representative survey of obstetricians and gynecologists, almost all surveyed clinicians indicated that they would perform a bimanual examination on asymptomatic patients during routine visits.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;According to another survey performed in 2009, 78% of surveyed clinicians (including obstetricians/gynecologists, family or general practitioners, and internists) believed that pelvic examination is useful for screening for gynecologic cancer in asymptomatic women; approximately 50% to 60% reported believing that pelvic examination is useful for cervical cancer screening, 49% to 70% for ovarian cancer (70% of obstetrician/gynecologists vs 49% to 50% of internists and family practitioners), 39% to 45% for uterine cancer, 57% to 62% for vaginal cancer, and 53% to 62% for vulvar cancer (estimates are based on graphic display of data, exact numbers were not provided).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;Nearly all surveyed clinicians (97%) believed that the pelvic examination included bimanual examination, while most (69%) believed that the pelvic examination included rectovaginal examination.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation8\">8</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes that research on the effectiveness of the screening pelvic examination is difficult, given that multiple conditions could potentially be detected with this single preventive service. However, in reviewing the currently available evidence on the benefits and harms of performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic adult women, the USPSTF identified the following critical evidence gaps. Studies evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of screening pelvic examination to detect conditions other than ovarian cancer, bacterial vaginosis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis are lacking. Studies reporting on the harms of screening with pelvic examination (including quantified psychological harms) in asymptomatic women in primary care are also lacking.</p>\r\n<p>Studies reporting the effects of performing routine screening pelvic examinations on health outcomes such as all-cause mortality, disease-specific morbidity and mortality, quality of life, and psychological benefits and harms could help fill the gaps in the existing evidence and inform future USPSTF recommendations. Studies evaluating and quantifying harms are needed, as well as studies evaluating the potential effectiveness of risk assessment tools to determine which women might benefit from a pelvic examination. Research is needed to clarify which indications primary care clinicians are currently using the screening pelvic examination for in asymptomatic patients and which components of the pelvic examination are performed most frequently. Studies exploring women&rsquo;s attitudes toward pelvic examinations, the outcomes women value from these examinations, and how pelvic examinations affect women&rsquo;s decisions to seek and obtain care are also needed to clarify the potential benefits and harms of providing this preventive service.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>For the purposes of this recommendation, the term \"pelvic examination\" includes any of the following components, alone or in combination: assessment of the external genitalia, internal speculum examination, bimanual palpation, and rectovaginal examination.</p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are not included in this recommendation statement on screening pelvic examinations because they are already addressed in separate USPSTF recommendations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation2\">2</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Screening for ovarian cancer with preventive services other than pelvic examination is addressed in the USPSTF's recommendation on screening for ovarian cancer;<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;the USPSTF also has recommendations on counseling to prevent sexually transmitted infections.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;The Women&rsquo;s Preventive Services Guidelines, supported by the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration, is another resource.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation11\">11</a></sup></p>",

      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Given the range of gynecologic conditions that could be detected with pelvic examination, the burden of disease varies depending on the specific condition. Some conditions, such as vaginal cancer, may be rare, with an incidence rate of 0.7 cases per 100,000 women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Other conditions, such as candidiasis, are relatively common, with nearly 75% of adult women reporting at least 1 occurrence.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Associated morbidity and mortality can also vary. Some conditions, such as ovarian cancer, may be associated with a high mortality rate (5-year survival rate of 46.2%),<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;while other conditions, such as candidiasis, may have no known associated mortality. More information on the burden and epidemiology of the numerous gynecologic conditions potentially detected by pelvic examination is available in Table 1 of the accompanying systematic evidence review.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and potential harms of performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adult women 18 years and older. The review focused on asymptomatic gynecologic conditions commonly identified by clinicians as a reason for performing the screening pelvic examination, conditions for which detection of early-stage disease in asymptomatic patients is biologically and clinically plausible, and conditions for which another method of screening is not already addressed by a current USPSTF recommendation (ie, cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia). The review excluded symptomatic conditions. The review included the following components of the pelvic examination: inspection of the external genitalia, urethral meatus, vaginal introitus, and perianal region; speculum examination of the vagina and cervix; bimanual palpation of the uterus, cervix, and adnexa; and rectovaginal examination of the posterior wall of the vagina.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on the accuracy of screening pelvic examinations to detect various conditions; 4 studies (n=26,432) reported on ovarian cancer, 2 studies (n=930) on bacterial vaginosis, 1 study (n=779) on genital herpes, and 1 study (n=779) on trichomoniasis.</p>\r\n<p>Of the 4 studies reporting on detection of ovarian cancer, the largest was the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;conducted in the United States. The PLCO trial, a good-quality population-based, randomized trial, recruited women aged 55 to 74 years (mean age, 62.9 years) without a history of cancer. It evaluated screening for ovarian cancer with ultrasonography and blood testing for the tumor marker cancer antigen 125 but originally included palpation of the ovaries in its screening protocol. The ovarian palpation component was discontinued 5 years into the study because no cases of ovarian cancer were detected solely with bimanual palpation of the ovaries.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;In a subanalysis that evaluated 20,872 participants who underwent ovarian palpation at least once, the yield of screening was 23 cancer cases (0.1%) detected over 1 year of follow-up and 72 cancer cases (0.3%) detected over 1 to 5 years of follow-up (Paul Pinsky, PhD, National Cancer Institute, written communication, May 2, 2016).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;Over multiple rounds of screening (mean number, 2.4 [range, 1&ndash;4]), 96.7% of the ovarian cancer cases identified during the trial were not detected by palpation. The reported sensitivity and specificity for detection of ovarian cancer over 1 to 5 years of follow-up in the PLCO trial was 2.8% (95% CI, 0.6 to 8.6) and 98.8% (95% CI, 98.7 to 99), respectively. The other 3 fair-quality studies were conducted in Greece, Australia, and the United Kingdom and were generally much smaller (n=1010 to 2550).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation15\">15-17</a></sup>&nbsp;Outcomes were reported at 1 year of follow-up, and the range of sensitivity and specificity was 0% to 100% and 91.4% to 98.4%, respectively.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The 4 studies that reported on the accuracy of pelvic examination to detect various infectious diseases (bacterial vaginosis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis) were all fair-quality and conducted in the United States.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;One study was conducted in a hospital setting,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;while the other 3 were conducted in sexually transmitted infection clinics.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation19\">19-21</a></sup>&nbsp;It is important to note that given the settings of these studies, participants were more likely to represent higher-risk, symptomatic populations compared with women generally seen in primary care. The reported yield of screening was 38.7% to 47.0% of bacterial vaginosis cases, 47.8% of genital herpes cases, and 15.2% of trichomoniasis cases.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Depending on the specific clinical sign used in screening, reported sensitivity ranged from 2.3% to 78.8% for bacterial vaginosis,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation18\">18</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;from 14.2% to 19.6% for genital herpes,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;and from 1.7% to 59.2% for trichomoniasis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation21\">21</a></sup>&nbsp;Specificity ranged from 48.4% to 100% for bacterial vaginosis,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation18\">18</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;from 97.1% to 97.5% for genital herpes,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;and from 72.0% to 100% for trichomoniasis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation21\">21</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection</h3>\r\n<p>No good- or fair-quality studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adult women to improve quality of life, reduce disease-specific morbidity, or reduce disease-specific or all-cause mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on the potential harms of screening pelvic examination. Studies reporting on the accuracy of screening pelvic examination to detect various gynecologic conditions also reported on false-positive and false-negative rates, which could lead to important harms due to missed diagnoses or unnecessary and potentially harmful procedures and treatment. The false-positive and false-negative rates at 1 year of follow-up in the PLCO trial subanalyses were 1.2% (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) and 95.7% (95% CI, 81.4 to 99.5), respectively.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;False-positive and false-negative rates in the other 3 ovarian cancer studies ranged from 1.6% to 8.6% and 0% to 100%, respectively.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The 4 studies reporting on the accuracy of screening with pelvic examination for ovarian cancer also reported the percentage of patients with positive results who subsequently underwent surgery, which overall ranged from 5% to 36%. Based on the PLCO trial subanalyses, 11.2% of women who had a positive palpation examination over up to 4 rounds of annual screening but did not ultimately receive an ovarian cancer diagnosis underwent surgery (Paul Pinsky, PhD, National Cancer Institute, written communication, May 2, 2016). Depending on the specific clinical sign used to detect various infectious diseases, the false-positive rate ranged from 0% to 46.1% for bacterial vaginosis, from 2.5% to 2.9% for genital herpes, and from 0% to 28.0% for trichomoniasis. The false-negative rate ranged from 21.2% to 97.7% for bacterial vaginosis, from 80.4% to 85.8% for genital herpes, and from 40.8% to 98.3% for trichomoniasis. Given the uncertainty regarding the accuracy of performing screening pelvic examinations to detect a range of gynecologic conditions, there is the potential for false-positive findings to cause harms by leading to unnecessary and invasive evaluations, including surgery; there is also the potential for false-negative findings to cause harms by providing false reassurance when clinically important conditions are actually present. One small (n=150) exploratory study reported on urinary tract infections in patients undergoing pelvic examination; however, the study was underpowered to detect any significant difference.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF searched for but did not find any studies that quantified harms of anxiety or other psychological harms associated with screening pelvic examination.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on screening pelvic examinations for the early detection and treatment of a range of gynecologic conditions in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adult women. No studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening pelvic examinations to improve health outcomes such as quality of life, morbidity, or mortality. Few studies reported on the accuracy of screening pelvic examination; among the range of possible gynecologic conditions that could be detected with pelvic examination, only 4 were evaluated in published studies, often in only a single study. Although studies on detection of ovarian cancer often recruited participants from the community, participants in studies evaluating detection of infectious diseases came from sexually transmitted infection clinics, whose populations are likely more symptomatic and at higher risk for disease than the typical primary care population, thus making the applicability of this evidence to primary care populations unclear. Overall, the current available evidence is insufficient for the USPSTF to determine the net balance of benefits and harms of screening pelvic examinations, and the USPSTF cannot recommend for or against performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adult women.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 28, 2016, to July 25, 2016. One concern expressed in the comments was the perception that the USPSTF was recommending against performing screening pelvic examinations and therefore against screening for cervical cancer. The USPSTF has clarified that it is recommending neither for nor against screening with pelvic examination for gynecologic conditions other than cervical cancer, gonorrhea, or chlamydia. The evidence on performing pelvic examinations to screen for conditions other than cervical cancer, gonorrhea, or chlamydia is currently lacking, and the USPSTF is unable to determine the overall balance of benefits and harms. However, as it has previously, the USPSTF continues to recommend screening for cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in separate recommendation statements. Some comments also expressed concern that the USPSTF based its recommendation on costs. The USPSTF has clarified that it does not consider the costs of a preventive service when determining a recommendation grade; it bases its recommendations on the quality and strength of the available evidence about the potential benefit and harms of a preventive service. Comments also expressed concern that the USPSTF did not sufficiently consider the harms of performing pelvic examinations and that the USPSTF should have recommended against performing them. The USPSTF reviewed all available relevant studies that reported on harms of pelvic examinations. Too few studies were available for the USPSTF to determine the net benefit or harm of performing screening pelvic examinations.</p>",

It may also manifest as nonspecific, nongastrointestinal symptoms, including anemia, osteoporosis, chronic fatigue, peripheral neuropathy or ataxia, and short stature.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Data from the United States suggest that some patients may have symptoms for years before being diagnosed.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation4\">4</a></sup>Evidence also suggests that celiac disease is associated with excess mortality, intestinal adenocarcinoma, and lymphoma; however, evidence is insufficient as to whether silent, or asymptomatic, disease has the same risk as symptomatic disease.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation5\">5-7</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In 3 US-based studies, the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed celiac disease ranged from 0.40% to 0.95% among adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Some variations in prevalence can be attributed in part to the method used to confirm diagnosis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;For example, some population-based studies on prevalence rely on serologic testing without histologic confirmation, which may result in false-positive diagnoses and overestimate prevalence. However, in a systematic review of 38 studies from North America and Western Europe, prevalence of celiac disease was similar among studies that included biopsy confirmation (0.15% to 1.90%) and among studies that did not include biopsy confirmation (0.15% to 2.70%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Celiac disease affects children, adolescents, and adults. Seroconversion to antibodies associated with celiac disease may occur at any time, and disease progression can take months or years, if it occurs at all.

In a higher-risk population, the positive predictive value is 40% to 80%, depending on the serologic test used and whether the assumed prevalence is 5% or 10%. Some patients with positive serology findings who do not undergo histologic confirmation may make efforts to avoid dietary gluten, which can increase costs and burdens and may result in limitations on quality of life. Limited evidence from 5 long-term follow-up studies (3 studies of patients with positive serology findings; 2 studies of children with biopsy confirmation) has shown that some persons who are diagnosed with celiac disease may never develop symptoms or complications; thus, overdiagnosis is also a potential concern.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation10\">10-12</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation18\">18</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation19\">19</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n<p>Reliable data on the frequency of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic persons in clinical practice are not available.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;It is not known how many patients with positive serology findings without biopsy confirmation are treated with a gluten-free diet.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for celiac disease is typically not performed in average-risk persons.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;The standard method of diagnosing celiac disease in symptomatic persons older than 2 years is the tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA test, followed by intestinal biopsy for histologic confirmation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet, which reverses disease manifestations in a majority of patients.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provides current, comprehensive, science-based information about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation21\">21</a></sup></p>",

Patients with potential celiac disease have positive serology findings and mild or no intestinal damage on biopsy; they may or may not have symptoms. The natural history of silent and potential celiac disease is not well understood, and it is not clear if they represent progressive stages of celiac disease or distinct subtypes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Data on the prevalence of silent celiac disease in the United States, as well as the proportion of these individuals who later develop symptomatic celiac disease, are limited.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Reported prevalence of celiac disease in the literature varies due to the different racial/ethnic populations studied and the method used to confirm diagnosis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;In a systematic review of 38 studies from North America and Western Europe, prevalence was similar among studies that included biopsy confirmation (0.15% to 1.90%) and among studies that did not (0.15% to 2.70%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;In the 3 US-based studies, prevalence among adults ranged from 0.40% to 0.95%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of screening in asymptomatic adults, adolescents, and children; the potential benefits and harms of screening vs not screening, as well as targeted vs universal screening; and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease.

These 2 cross-sectional studies, which were both conducted outside the United States, found lower sensitivity and specificity for the tTG and EMA IgA tests (sensitivity, 57% to 71%; specificity, 83% to 98%), compared with studies that did not restrict enrollment to asymptomatic patients. One study was conducted in Iraq among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, no symptoms of celiac disease, and no family history of celiac disease or thyroid disorders.

Potential harms of screening include false-positive, inconclusive, or unnecessary serologic test results and biopsies, with possible anxiety or complications from testing. However, the USPSTF found no studies on these harms. A subset of patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease may never develop symptoms; therefore, overdiagnosis is also a potential concern.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>One small fair-quality trial of treatment with a gluten-free diet<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/celiac-disease-screening#citation27\">27</a></sup>&nbsp; reported no withdrawals due to major symptoms or complications.

The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the potential benefits and harms of screening vs not screening, as well as targeted vs universal screening in asymptomatic populations. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the potential benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease compared with no treatment or treatment after clinical diagnosis.

Many comments described patients&rsquo; personal experience of a delayed diagnosis because of atypical or nonspecific symptoms. In response, the USPSTF expanded the \"Suggestions for Practice\" section to call attention to the prevalence of nonclassical symptoms, including anemia and osteoporosis, and delayed diagnosis. Another frequently raised concern was the higher risk among relatives of patients with celiac disease and patients with other autoimmune diseases. The USPSTF revised the \"Research Needs and Gaps\" section to emphasize the importance of developing evidence to guide clinical practice for this population.</p>",

The specific etiology of preeclampsia is unclear.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation2\">2-6</a></sup>&nbsp;Preeclampsia can lead to poor health outcomes in both the mother and infant.

It can quickly evolve into a severe disease that can result in serious, even fatal health outcomes for the mother and infant. The ability to screen for preeclampsia using blood pressure measurements is important to identify and effectively treat a potentially unpredictable and fatal condition.

This assessment was based on the known harms of treatment with antihypertension medications, induced labor, and magnesium sulfate; the likely few harms from screening with blood pressure measurements; and the potential poor maternal and perinatal outcomes resulting from severe untreated preeclampsia and eclampsia.

Although the 24-hour urine protein test is the gold standard, it is not practical for use in primary care. The USPSTF found variable and limited evidence on the accuracy of these tests.</p>\r\n<p>Fourteen studies (n=1888; 4 good quality and 10 fair quality) assessed the diagnostic accuracy of urine tests in detecting proteinuria compared with 24-hour urine collection (gold standard). Twelve studies assessed the protein to creatinine ratio urine test, 2 studies assessed the albumin to creatinine ratio urine test, and 4 studies assessed the urine protein dipstick test. Evidence on the accuracy of repeat testing was not found.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;All studies of urine protein test performance were conducted among pregnant women with suspected preeclampsia. Six studies took place in the United States, 4 in the United Kingdom, and 1 each in New Zealand, Canada, Chile, and the Netherlands.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Meta-analysis was not performed due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity across the studies.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Sensitivity of the protein to creatinine ratio urine test ranged from 0.65 to 0.96 (<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&nbsp;= 80.5%; 11 studies), with most studies reporting sensitivity greater than 0.81; specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.00 (<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&nbsp;= 91.8%; 11 studies). The albumin to creatinine ratio urine test (2 studies) had high sensitivity (0.94 and 1.00) and dissimilar specificity (0.94 and 0.68).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The automated urine protein dipstick test (4 studies) had sensitivity ranging from 0.22 to 1.00 and specificity ranging from 0.36 to 1.00.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;One automated urine protein dipstick test had both specificity and sensitivity near 0.80. The remaining studies found either high sensitivity and low specificity or vice versa.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Performance of urine tests for protein varied widely. Issues such as limited information on the diversity of index tests used, study eligibility criteria, prevalence of proteinuria, spectrum bias, and heterogeneity limit the conclusions that can be made about the accuracy of urine tests for protein in routine clinical care. In addition, the studies were conducted among pregnant women with suspected preeclampsia and not in the general asymptomatic pregnant population typically found in primary care.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence suggests that automated tests have better test performance than manually read tests. The time of day of testing is not predictive of performance for the protein to creatinine ratio test.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Risk Prediction</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 16 multivariable risk-prediction models evaluated in 4 external validation studies.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The risk models had different outcomes: predicting any preeclampsia, early-onset preeclampsia requiring delivery prior to 34 weeks of gestation, or preeclampsia occurring or requiring delivery after 34 weeks of gestation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Five of the 16 externally validated multivariable risk-prediction models had good or better discrimination (<em>c</em>&nbsp;statistic &ge;0.80), but all had low positive predictive value (4% to 39%). There was insufficient information on discrimination and no information on calibration from validation studies to comprehensively evaluate model performance.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition, the models used serum markers and Doppler ultrasonography, which are not always available in primary care and are not generally used in the first trimester of routine prenatal care.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;None of the risk models were based solely on patient history or clinical indicators that could be captured during prenatal visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies directly compared the effectiveness of screening for preeclampsia on health outcomes in a screened vs unscreened population. One randomized clinical trial examined the benefits and harms of a reduced prenatal visit schedule. This trial was an opportunity to evaluate a specific screening approach compared with the standard of care. This fair-quality trial (n=2764) among low-risk pregnant women showed that fewer prenatal care visits (9 vs 14 visits) did not result in worse maternal or neonatal health outcomes at delivery. However, the mean difference in the number of visits between groups was smaller than intended (12.0 [SD, 4.2] vs 14.7 [SD, 4.2];&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;&lt;0.001), and the study was underpowered to detect difference for some health outcomes. In addition, the trial was published nearly 20 years ago, and there have since been changes to clinical practice in the United States.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation23\">23</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Although the USPSTF found no recent studies on the direct effectiveness of screening for preeclampsia in improving health outcomes, trial evidence and extensive clinical experience provide evidence of effective treatments for preeclampsia. Antihypertension medications, when indicated, and administration of magnesium sulfate reduce the risk of adverse events. The Magpie Trial (n=10,141), an international randomized clinical trial of treatment with magnesium sulfate, showed a benefit for preventing eclampsia. Pregnant women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia who were given magnesium sulfate had a 58% lower risk of eclampsia (95% CI, 40% to 71%) than women who received placebo.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;Incidence of placental abruption was significantly lower in the treatment group, and there was no evidence of short- or longer-term (&le;2 years) harms from treatment for the mother or infant.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;A Cochrane review of anticonvulsant management of preeclampsia found that treatment with magnesium sulfate reduced the risk of eclampsia by more than half and also likely reduced maternal mortality.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation25\">25</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In studies of timing of delivery, trial evidence supports delivery of the fetus to reduce the risk of adverse maternal outcomes in women with preeclampsia after 37 weeks of gestation. The large multicenter HYPITAT (Hypertension and Preeclampsia Intervention Trial at Term) found that immediate delivery of the fetus reduced the risk of composite adverse maternal outcomes in women with preeclampsia after 37 weeks of gestation (relative risk, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.86];&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;&lt;0.0001), with no difference in the cesarean delivery rate or neonatal outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation26\">26</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Previous evidence reviews commissioned by the USPSTF found good-quality evidence that measuring blood pressure has few major harms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of screening for and risk prediction of preeclampsia.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 2 fair-quality studies that reported on potential harms of alternative approaches to screening for preeclampsia. Neither study found evidence of harms, but both were underpowered to provide evidence on rare clinical outcomes. One was a fair-quality trial (n=2764) that found no difference in birth outcomes (eg, low birth weight, preterm birth, or cesarean delivery) when the number of prenatal care visits was reduced from 14 to 9 visits.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;As noted earlier, this trial was not sufficiently powered to detect differences for rare outcomes related to preeclampsia such as progression to eclampsia, organ failure, stroke, and death.</p>\r\n<p>The second study was a fair-quality, retrospective, before-after comparison cohort study (n=1952) of low-income pregnant Hispanic women. The study did not identify any harms related to preeclampsia diagnosis and birth outcomes when targeted urine protein screening was used for specific indications only compared with routine use in prenatal care.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation27\">27</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>One fair-quality prospective cohort study (n=255) conducted in Spain found no difference in anxiety before and after counseling on preeclampsia risk and categorization as high or low risk based on results of a multivariable risk prediction model. High-risk women were subject to changes in their clinical care, and the low-risk group received usual care. Measures of anxiety over time did not change but were collected from less than half of the study participants.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation28\">28</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The potential harms of treating preeclampsia are well established and include preterm delivery, neonatal complications, cesarean delivery, and adverse effects from magnesium sulfate (eg, nausea, headache, blurry vision, and floppy infant) and antihypertension medications (eg, fatigue, headache, and nausea).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation29\">29</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Given the evidence that treatment can reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, and the well-established accuracy of blood pressure measurements, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for preeclampsia results in a substantial benefit for the mother and infant. In addition, there is adequate evidence to bound the harms of screening for and treatment of preeclampsia as no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of screening for preeclampsia in pregnant women.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Preeclampsia is a complex syndrome among a range of hypertension disorders occurring during pregnancy. Preeclampsia may involve abnormal formation of uterine arteries during placental development or increased oxidative stress and a maternal inflammatory response (or both).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation2\">2-4</a></sup>&nbsp;Although the condition may remain stable until delivery, it can rapidly and unpredictably result in serious, even fatal health outcomes for the mother and infant.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/preeclampsia-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 27 to October 24, 2016. Some comments requested elaboration on the urine protein dipstick test. In response, the USPSTF addressed testing for proteinuria in the Clinical Considerations and Rationale sections. Some comments requested more information on screening intervals, which is provided in the Clinical Considerations. Other comments requested clarification about risk prediction of preeclampsia. In response, the USPSTF added information about risk prediction models to the Rationale and Discussion sections.</p>",

The review also assessed the diagnostic accuracy of screening (including neck palpation and ultrasound) and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected thyroid cancer, which were not part of the previous evidence review.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence on the accuracy of screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation or ultrasound is very limited, with only 2 applicable studies for each screening method, all of which compared the screening method with a reference standard in a screening population. Two fair-quality prospective studies from Finland by the same investigator reported low sensitivity for neck palpation to detect thyroid nodules.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;In a study of randomly selected adults (n=253), 5.1% had abnormal findings on neck examination (thyroid nodule or diffuse enlargement), and sensitivity and specificity to detect thyroid nodules were 11.6% (95% CI, 5.1% to 21.6%) and 97.3% (95% CI, 93.8% to 99.1%), respectively.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;One study of women presenting for mammography (n=101) reported sensitivity of 27.8% for neck palpation to detect thyroid nodules in women with an abnormal ultrasound finding (women with negative neck palpation findings were not followed up, so the false-positive rate could not be estimated).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation9\">9</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Two fair-quality population-based studies, both conducted in South Korea by the same investigator, reported on diagnostic accuracy of screening using ultrasound only.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation11\">11</a></sup>&nbsp;The prospective study (n=2079 screened; 113 referred for biopsy with fine needle aspiration) found that the sensitivity and specificity of having 1 or more malignant features (ie, microcalcification or irregular shape) detected on screening ultrasound were 94.3% (95% CI, 84.3% to 98.8%) and 55.0% (95% CI, 41.6% to 67.9%), respectively. A retrospective analysis of 130 asymptomatic persons selected from 1009 persons who had biopsy with fine-needle aspiration, based on ultrasound findings (ie, having &ge;2 high-risk sonographic characteristics), reported sensitivity and specificity of 94.8% and 86.6%, respectively (calculated per thyroid nodule rather than per patient; CIs not provided). However, this study did not follow up patients with negative ultrasound findings, and therefore may have overestimated the sensitivity of this screening method.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies directly compared patient health outcomes for screened vs unscreened populations. No randomized trials evaluated whether earlier treatment or treatment of screen-detected, well-differentiated thyroid cancer results in better patient outcomes compared with observation (ie, delayed or no treatment).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Two observational studies (reported in 5 articles)<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation12\">12-16</a></sup>&nbsp;met the inclusion criteria for benefit of early treatment. One fair-quality, retrospective, observational study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 1973 to 2005 compared survival rates of persons treated (n=35,663) vs not treated (n=440) for papillary thyroid cancer.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;Overall, untreated persons had a slightly worse 20-year survival rate compared with treated persons (97% vs 99%;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;&lt;0.001). However, there were statistically significant baseline differences between the 2 groups, and the study did not adjust for potential confounding.</p>\r\n<p>Another fair-quality prospective study conducted in Japan reported the recurrence and survival rates for 2 separate cohorts (1993&ndash;2004 and 2005&ndash;2013) with papillary microcarcinoma.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation13\">13-16</a></sup>&nbsp;In the first cohort, 1055 persons chose treatment with immediate surgery and 340 opted for surveillance. After approximately 6 years of follow-up, 32.1% of patients who opted for surveillance had surgery, and 2 patients in the immediate surgery group and none in the observation group had died. In the second cohort, 974 persons opted for treatment with immediate surgery, and 1179 opted for active surveillance. After approximately 4 years of follow-up, 8% of patients who opted for active surveillance had surgery, and no patients in either group developed distant metastases or died of thyroid cancer. Because of major limitations in the design of both studies (eg, lack of adjustment for confounding), it is uncertain whether earlier or immediate treatment vs delayed or no surgical treatment improves patient outcomes for papillary carcinoma or microcarcinoma.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies directly examined the harms of screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation or ultrasound. Overall, evidence on the harms of screening for thyroid cancer is very limited, including harms of diagnostic biopsy with fine-needle aspiration (eg, hospitalization, postprocedural hematoma, and needle tract implementation).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation5\">5</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF found 36 fair-quality studies reporting on surgical harms, 32 studies on permanent hypoparathyroidism (hypocalcemia), 28 studies on permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (vocal cord paralysis), 2 studies on surgical mortality, and 15 studies on other major surgical harms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;The majority of studies were retrospective observational studies, although 3 randomized trials were included. Cohort size ranged from 76 to 13,854 persons. Only 7 studies were conducted in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Considerable evidence documents the harms of treatment with surgery and radioactive iodine therapy. The rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism varied widely (15 study arms); best estimates were 2 to 6 events per 100 total thyroidectomies, and estimates varied more with lymph node dissection. The rate of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy varied less (14 study arms), at an estimated 1 to 2 events per 100 operations (with or without lymph node dissection). Sixteen fair-quality studies (n=94,823) provided evidence for potential harms of radioactive iodine remnant ablation or therapy.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;Estimates of a secondary malignancy ranged from approximately 12 to 13 excess cancers per 10,000 person-years,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation19\">19</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;and salivary gland harms (eg, dry mouth) ranged from 2.3 to 21 events per 100 persons.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation21\">21-26</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Although no direct studies of whether screening causes overdiagnosis exist, ecological and cross-sectional data suggest that screening for thyroid cancer leads to an increase in incidence without any resulting change in mortality.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Multiple studies in the United States show a rising incidence in thyroid cancer detection over time, with no corresponding change in the mortality rate.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;The best ecological evidence on the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer comes from South Korea, which has had an organized cancer screening program since 1999.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation27\">27</a></sup>Although the program did not officially include screening for thyroid cancer, clinicians frequently offered thyroid screening using ultrasound for a small additional cost. In 2011, the rate of thyroid cancer diagnosis was 15 times the rate in 1993, while the thyroid cancer&ndash;specific mortality rate remained stable.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation27\">27</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Autopsy studies provide additional evidence on overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer. A 2014 review by Lee et al<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-cancer-screening1#citation28\">28</a></sup>&nbsp;summarizes 15 studies published between 1969 and 2005 on latent thyroid cancer discovered at autopsy. Of the 8619 thyroid glands incidentally obtained at autopsy, 989 (11.5%) tested positive for papillary thyroid carcinoma. The majority of the tumors were tiny (diameter &lt;1 to 3 mm).</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening but determined that the magnitude of the overall benefits of screening and treatment can be bounded as no greater than small, given the relative rarity of thyroid cancer, the apparent lack of difference in outcomes between treatment and surveillance (for the most common tumor types), and observational evidence showing no change in mortality over time after introduction of a mass screening program. Similarly, the USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the harms of screening but determined that the magnitude of the overall harms of screening and treatment can be bounded as at least moderate, given adequate evidence of harms of treatment and indirect evidence that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely to be substantial with population-based screening. Therefore, the USPSTF determined with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for thyroid cancer is negative.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 22 to December 26, 2016. Many respondents shared personal stories of how their clinician noticed a lump during physical examination, often prompted by symptoms such as hoarseness or throat pain, and expressed concern that the recommendation would prevent diagnosis of such cancer cases. Clinicians who interpreted the recommendation as discouraging them from performing neck examination also expressed concern. In response, the USPSTF expanded the Clinical Considerations section to clarify that this recommendation does not apply to persons who experience hoarseness, pain, difficulty swallowing, or other throat symptoms or persons who have lumps, swelling, asymmetry of the neck, or to other reasons for a neck examination.</p>",

Children and adolescents also may experience teasing and bullying behaviors based on their weight. Obesity in childhood and adolescence may continue into adulthood and lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes or other obesity-related morbidity, such as type 2 diabetes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>In 2005, the USPSTF found that age- and sex-adjusted BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) percentile is the accepted measure for detecting overweight or obesity in children and adolescents because it is feasible for use in primary care, a reliable measure, and associated with adult obesity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation7\">7-9</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment or Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening and intensive behavioral interventions for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older can lead to improvements in weight status. The magnitude of this benefit is moderate.</p>\r\n<p>Studies on pharmacotherapy interventions (ie, metformin and orlistat) showed small amounts of weight loss. The magnitude of this benefit is of uncertain clinical significance, because the evidence regarding the effectiveness of metformin and orlistat is inadequate.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment or Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of screening and comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions for obesity in children and adolescents as small to none, based on the likely minimal harms of using BMI as a screening tool, the absence of reported harms in the evidence on behavioral interventions, and the noninvasive nature of the interventions.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence on the harms associated with metformin is inadequate. Adequate evidence shows that orlistat has moderate harms, including abdominal pain or cramping, flatus with discharge, fecal incontinence, and fatty or oily stools.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older and offering or referring them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote improvements in weight status is moderate.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to children and adolescents 6 years and older.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Although all children and adolescents are at risk for obesity and should be screened, there are several specific risk factors, including parental obesity, poor nutrition, low levels of physical activity, inadequate sleep, sedentary behaviors, and low family income.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Risk factors associated with obesity in younger children include maternal diabetes, maternal smoking, gestational weight gain, and rapid infant growth. A decrease in physical activity in young children is a risk factor for obesity later in adolescence. Obesity rates continue to increase in some racial/ethnic minority populations. These racial/ethnic differences in obesity prevalence are likely a result of both genetic and nongenetic factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and fast food, and having a television in the bedroom).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;The prevalence of obesity is approximately 21% to 25% among African American and Hispanic children 6 years and older.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;In contrast, the prevalence of obesity ranges from 3.7% among Asian girls aged 6 to 11 years to 20.9% among non-Hispanic white adolescent girls.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Body mass index measurement is the recommended screening test for obesity. Body mass index percentile is plotted on growth charts, such as those developed by the CDC, which are based on US-specific, population-based norms for children 2 years and older.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Obesity is defined as an age- and sex-specific BMI in the 95th percentile or greater.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence regarding appropriate screening intervals for obesity in children and adolescents. Height and weight, which are necessary for BMI calculation, are routinely measured during health maintenance visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes the challenges that children and their families encounter in having limited access to effective, intensive behavioral interventions for obesity. Identifying obesity in children and how to address it are important steps in helping children and families obtain the support they need.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found that comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions with a total of 26 contact hours or more over a period of 2 to 12 months resulted in weight loss (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#table1\">Table 1</a>).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Behavioral interventions with a total of 52 contact hours or more demonstrated greater weight loss and some improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. These effective, higher-intensity (&ge;26 contact hours) behavioral interventions consisted of multiple components.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Although these components varied across interventions, they frequently included sessions targeting both the parent and child (separately, together, or both); offered individual sessions (both family and group); provided information about healthy eating, safe exercising, and reading food labels; encouraged the use of stimulus control (e.g., limiting access to tempting foods and limiting screen time), goal setting, self-monitoring, contingent rewards, and problem solving; and included supervised physical activity sessions. Intensive interventions involving 52 or more contact hours rarely took place in primary care settings but rather in settings to which primary care clinicians could refer patients. These types of interventions were often delivered by multidisciplinary teams, including pediatricians, exercise physiologists or physical therapists, dieticians or diet assistants, psychologists or social workers, or other behavioral specialists.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Adherence to interventions can change their effectiveness. In the included trials, 68% to 95% of participants completed all of the sessions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>Lower adherence in clinical practice could decrease the overall benefit of these interventions.</p>\r\n<p>Metformin has been used for weight loss in children but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. Metformin has a small effect on weight (BMI reduction &lt;1), and this effect is of uncertain clinical significance. Although the harms of metformin use are probably small, evidence regarding long-term outcomes of its use is lacking. In addition, participants in the metformin trials had abnormal insulin or glucose metabolism, and most had severe obesity. This limits the applicability of the results to a general pediatric population with obesity. Orlistat is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in adolescents 12 years and older. However, orlistat also has a small effect on weight (BMI reduction &lt;1), and this effect is of uncertain clinical significance. In addition, orlistat is associated with moderate harms. Therefore, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary effective intervention for weight loss in children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Clinically Important Weight Loss</em></h4>\r\n<p>Research studies use a standardized measure (<em>z</em>&nbsp;score) of BMI known as BMI&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;score. This measure helps compare results among children of different ages and over time as children grow. A few observational studies have addressed the question of what change in BMI&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;score or excess weight represents a clinically important change. These studies showed that a BMI&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;score reduction of 0.15 to 0.25 is associated with improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;A German expert panel determined that a BMI&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;score reduction of 0.20 is clinically significant and is comparable to a weight loss of approximately 5%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation11\">11</a></sup>&nbsp;A BMI&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;score reduction in the range of 0.20 to 0.25 appears to be a suitable threshold for clinically important change.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>An analysis by Epstein et al of 10-year outcomes from 4 randomized clinical trials of family-based behavioral obesity treatment programs suggested an association between weight loss in childhood and decreased risk of obesity in early adulthood.

      "other": "<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified several areas in need of further research. Trials evaluating the direct benefit and harms of screening for obesity in children and adolescents are needed. One such trial could implement a systematic screening and treatment program in 1 set of clinics and providers and continue with usual care in a separate set of clinics and providers. Reproducing existing effective interventions and conducting full trials of small feasibility studies are necessary next steps. Further investigations to determine the specific effective components of behavioral interventions are needed. Long-term follow-up of participants after completion of treatment is needed to confirm maintenance of weight loss and to assess long-term benefits and harms. More studies are needed that address behavioral interventions in diverse populations and younger children (age &le;5 years). Also, more evidence is needed about what constitutes clinically important health benefits and the amount of weight loss associated with those health benefits. The quality of study methods and reporting in recent studies is much better than in the earlier literature; however, the field would benefit further from improved consistency in how health outcomes are reported. Individual-patient meta-analysis could be beneficial in helping understand the differences between patients who lose weight and those who do not. Efficacy and safety trials of weight loss medications for pediatric populations with obesity are needed</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>\r\n<p>In 2007, an American Medical Association expert committee recommended that clinicians&rsquo; assessments include BMI calculation as well as medical and behavioral risk factors for obesity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation26\">26</a></sup>&nbsp;The American Academy of Pediatrics endorsed these recommendations and further recommends annually plotting BMI on a growth chart for all patients 2 years and older.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation27\">27</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2011, a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute expert panel recommended using BMI to screen for obesity in children and adolescents aged 2 to 21 years at high risk for obesity (ie, due to history of parental obesity, excessive gain in BMI, or change in physical activity).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation28\">28</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2015, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health recommended growth monitoring for all children and adolescents 17 years and younger at all appropriate primary care visits. It also recommends that primary care clinicians offer or refer children and adolescents with overweight or obesity to structured behavioral interventions aimed at healthy weight management.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation29\">29</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The National Academies Health and Medicine Division (formerly the Institute of Medicine) recommends that clinicians measure weight and length or height at every well-child visit using World Health Organization (0 to 23 months) or CDC (24 to 59 months) growth charts.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation30\">30</a></sup>&nbsp;The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners recommends assessing height and weight parameters, including height to weight ratio, in children younger than 2 years and BMI in children 2 years and older.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation31\">31</a></sup>.</p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Recent prevalence figures from 2011 to 2012 indicate that 17% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years in the United States have obesity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years are more likely to have obesity than children aged 2 to 5 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;. Although overt cardiovascular disease can take many years to develop, obesity is associated with poor cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes during childhood (e.g., high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, and insulin resistance). In addition, conditions such as asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, orthopedic problems, early maturation, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hepatic steatosis are associated with childhood and adolescent obesity. Children may experience low self-esteem, impaired quality of life, and teasing and bullying behaviors based on their weight.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Obesity can have short-term effects on the health of children and adolescents. In addition, obesity in childhood and adolescence often leads to obesity in adulthood, which leads to poor health outcomes. Large, prospective longitudinal studies show that almost 80% of adolescents with obesity will have obesity as adults (70% when BMI is measured at age &ge;30 years).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;Approximately 64% of preadolescents with obesity also had obesity as adults. Meta-analyses have shown a strong association between childhood and adult obesity; children with obesity are about 5 times more likely to have obesity as adults than children without obesity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF examined the evidence on screening for obesity in children and adolescents and the benefits and harms of weight management interventions. Bariatric surgery, which is limited to patients with morbid obesity, and obesity prevention interventions among children of normal weight were considered to be outside the scope of this review.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF previously found evidence that BMI is an adequate screening measure for identifying children and adolescents with obesity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation7\">7-9</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence addressing the benefits of screening for obesity in children and adolescents to improve intermediate or health outcomes.

Of these, 42 trials (n=6956) used multicomponent interventions targeting lifestyle change (e.g., counseling on diet, increasing physical activity or decreasing sedentary behavior, and addressing behavior change) to limit weight gain or decrease weight. Three smaller trials assessed different behavioral approaches (weight loss maintenance, regulation of cues for overeating, and interpersonal therapy).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Of the 42 behavioral intervention trials (n=6956), 8 were good quality and 34 were fair quality.

The remaining trials were conducted outside of a health care setting. Trials included children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years; almost half of the trials were limited to elementary school&ndash;aged children (6 to 8 years, up to 12 years).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>Slightly more than half of the participants were girls.

Time of contact in the interventions ranged from 0.25 to 122 hours (over 1 to 122 sessions); 7 studies had 52 contact hours or more, 9 studies had 26 to 51 contact hours, 11 studies had 6 to 25 contact hours, and 15 studies had 15 contact hours or less.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Sessions took place over 2.25 to 24 months. Data on follow-up beyond 1 year were limited. Trials with minimal contact time (&le;5 hours) were often conducted in primary care settings and involved individual sessions.</p>\r\n<p>All of the effective behavioral interventions included parents and delivered basic instructive information about healthy nutrition and physical activity. Additional components of the most effective interventions included being conducted in a specialty setting; targeting both children and their parents; helping parents and children engage in stimulus control (e.g., limiting access to tempting foods and limiting screen time); and assisting participants in identifying goals, self-monitoring, and problem solving to accomplish their selected goals. Trials with 52 contact hours or more often included supervised physical activity sessions, as did approximately half of the trials with 26 to 51 contact hours.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>Other common components included contingent use of rewards or reinforcement, motivational interviewing, teaching of coping skills, addressing body image, and the option of individual-family counseling to address family-specific issues. All of the effective studies emphasized eating healthy foods and using moderate portions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>All 7 trials with 52 contact hours or more demonstrated benefits of treatment, with a pooled standardized mean difference in change of -1.10 (95% CI, -1.30 to -0.89;&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>=43%) (1 study did not have adequate data to pool).

Most participants maintained their baseline weight within 5 lb while growing in height. In comparison, control groups showed small increases or reductions in BMI&nbsp;<em>z</em>&nbsp;score of less than 0.10 or weight gain of 5 to 17 lb (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#table2\">Table 2</a>).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Interventions were effective in reducing excess weight in children and adolescents after 6 to 12 months. Across all categories of intervention intensity, children in both the intervention and control groups showed a broad range of effects. Some participants had large reductions in weight, some showed no or modest changes, and some continued to gain weight.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Very limited evidence suggests that briefer interventions may be effective in children with overweight only.

Rates of discontinuation due to adverse effects were twice as common in the intervention group as in the placebo group (3.2% vs 1.7%, respectively).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;However, prescribing data from the United Kingdom show that rates of orlistat discontinuation among adolescents are about 50% after 1 month.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation22\">22</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that BMI is an acceptable measure for screening for excess weight in children and adolescents. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions in children and adolescents 6 years and older who have obesity can result in improvements in weight status for up to 12 months. It found inadequate evidence regarding the effectiveness of less intensive interventions. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of behavioral interventions as small to none and judged the harms of screening to be minimal. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older is of moderate net benefit.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Genetics and various environmental factors play important roles in the development of obesity. Once obesity has developed, an individual&rsquo;s biochemical feedback mechanisms work to sustain the body&rsquo;s weight gain.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;Changes in neuronal signaling decrease satiety and perceptions of the amount of food eaten.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;As a result, weight loss can be challenging. Prospective data suggest that cardiovascular risk factors among adults without obesity are similar between those who had obesity as children and those who did not.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;This suggests that adverse cardiovascular effects in childhood may be reversible with weight loss. This is of particular importance because obesity in childhood and adolescence may continue into adulthood and lead to poor health outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 1 to November 28, 2016. Many comments asked about the components of effective interventions. In response, the USPSTF added language in the \"Effectiveness of Early Detection and Interventions\" section to describe the components of effective interventions and the types of health professionals who would deliver care in these interventions. Another frequently raised concern was the lack of a recommendation for children younger than 6 years. The USPSTF added language in the aforementioned section on the lack of sufficient evidence in young children. The USPSTF added language about subgroup analyses, access, and research gaps based on comments.</p>",

All persons, regardless of their CVD risk status, can gain health benefits from healthy eating behaviors and appropriate physical activity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions provide at least a small benefit for reduction of CVD risk in adults without obesity who do not have the common risk factors for CVD (hypertension, dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, or diabetes). Behavioral counseling interventions have been found to improve healthful behaviors, including beneficial effects on fruit and vegetable consumption, total daily caloric intake, salt intake, and physical activity levels. Behavioral counseling interventions led to improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference that persisted over 6 to 12 months. The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence that behavioral counseling interventions lead to a reduction&nbsp;in mortality or CVD rates.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of behavioral counseling interventions are small to none. Among 14 trials of behavioral interventions that reported on adverse events, none reported any serious adverse events.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity have a small net benefit in adults without obesity who do not have specific common risk factors for CVD (hypertension, dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, and diabetes).</p>\r\n<p>Although the correlation among healthful diet, physical activity, and CVD incidence is strong, existing evidence indicates that the health benefit of behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity among adults without obesity who do not have these specific CVD risk factors is small.</p>",

Medium- and high-intensity interventions commonly included face-to-face individual or group counseling or both, with telephone, email, and text message follow-up. These more intensive interventions ranged in duration from 4 weeks to 6 years, with the active intervention period often lasting for 6 months. Interventions were delivered by primary care clinicians, health educators, behavioral health specialists, nutritionists or dieticians, exercise specialists, and lay coaches. Behavioral change techniques included goal setting and planning, monitoring and feedback, motivational interviewing, addressing barriers to change, increasing social support, and general education and advice. Adherence to all interventions was relatively high; adherence to high-intensity interventions was generally lower than for less-intensive interventions. Overall, there appeared to be a dose-response effect, with higher-intensity interventions demonstrating greater and statistically significant benefits. However, this dose-response effect was not seen for interventions targeting physical activity only, among which some low-intensity interventions demonstrated benefit.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes the important contributions of public health approaches to improving diet, increasing physical activity levels, and preventing CVD.

The USPSTF therefore suggests that health care professionals also consider offering or referring adults who are not overweight or do not have obesity but who have hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both to behavioral counseling on an individual basis.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found very limited evidence on the effect of behavioral interventions to reduce sedentary behaviors. Given the link between sedentary behaviors and cardiovascular risk, this is an important area for future research. Continued research on individually tailored, computer-based interventions that can be delivered via the internet, social media, and text messaging is needed. Novel research methods should be applied to understand longer-term health effects of behavioral interventions and to improve understanding of the association between changes in behaviors, changes in intermediate risk factors, and improvements in health outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>\r\n<p><span>In 2010, the American Heart Association</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation23\">23</a></sup><span>&nbsp;recommended that clinicians use counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity that include a combination of 2 or more of the following strategies: setting specific, proximal goals; providing feedback on progress; providing strategies for self-monitoring; establishing a plan for frequency and duration of follow-up; using motivational interviews; and building self-efficacy.

When all good- and fair-quality intervention trials were pooled, they demonstrated statistically significant improvements in systolic blood pressure level (&minus;1.26 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;1.77 to &minus;0.75]), diastolic blood pressure level (&minus;0.49 mm Hg [95% CI,&minus;0.82 to &minus;0.16]), LDL-C level (&minus;2.58 mg/dL [95% CI, &minus;4.30 to &minus;0.85]), total cholesterol level (&minus;2.85 mg/dL [95% CI, &minus;4.95 to &minus;0.75]), and adiposity measures such as BMI (&minus;0.41 [95% CI, &minus;0.62 to &minus;0.19]), weight (&minus;1.04 kg [95% CI, &minus;1.56 to &minus;0.51]), and waist circumference (1.19 cm [95% CI, &minus;1.79 to &minus;0.59]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;There was no evidence of an association between behavioral counseling interventions and improvements in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or fasting glucose when the interventions were pooled. Among the intermediate outcomes showing a positive association, dose-response effects were seen, with increasing intervention intensity associated with greater improvement in intermediate outcomes. There was limited evidence for effects lasting beyond 12 months.</p>\r\n<h4>Health Behavior Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 86 trials, involving more than 115,000 persons, that reported on behavioral outcomes such as fruit and vegetable consumption, salt intake, and minutes per week of physical activity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Almost all trials used self-reported measures for behavioral outcomes. Although substantial statistical heterogeneity prevented pooled analysis, in general, healthful diet interventions were associated with reduced saturated fat, sodium, and total caloric energy intake and increased fruit and vegetable and fiber intake. Physical activity interventions resulted in an increase of approximately 35 minutes of physical activity per week and 32% higher odds of meeting recommended physical activity guidelines.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Studies that limited enrollment to persons who did not meet physical activity guidelines at baseline had greater increases in physical activity levels compared with studies that included persons who were already active at baseline.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Among the 32 trials reporting both intermediate and behavioral outcomes, concordant changes were generally seen in behavioral outcomes when positive findings were seen in intermediate outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;For example, trials that found significant improvements in blood pressure levels generally also found significant reductions in measures of sodium intake. Studies that found reductions in waist circumference also reported increased physical activity levels. Several studies demonstrated improvements in behavioral outcomes but did not find concordant improvements in intermediate outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 4 trials that reported on measures of sedentary behavior.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Although there were some small but significant effects, the results were not consistent.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Of the 88 trials reviewed by the USPSTF, 14 specifically reported on adverse events.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;No trials reported any serious adverse events related to the counseling intervention. Eight trials reported on the incidence of important patient events, including falls, injuries, and cardiovascular events. Seven trials found no difference between intervention and control groups. One trial in women aged 40 to 74 years reported more injuries among intervention participants over 24 months of follow-up (19% vs 14%;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;= 0.03). This trial also reported more falls in the intervention group (37% vs 29%;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;&lt; 0.001).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/healthful-diet-and-physical-activity-for-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-in-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling#citation21\">21</a></sup>&nbsp;Four other trials reporting falls, 2 in older adults and 2 in general primary care populations, found no difference between intervention and control groups over 12 months of follow-up.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF assessed the overall effectiveness of behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity to be positive but small. Counseling interventions result in improvements in healthful behaviors and small but potentially important improvements in intermediate outcomes, including reductions in blood pressure and LDL-C levels and improvements in measures of adiposity. Noting the concordance between behavioral and intermediate outcomes and the apparent dose-response effect of behavioral interventions on intermediate and behavioral outcomes, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence is adequate to establish the benefits of behavioral counseling interventions. The USPSTF concluded that the overall magnitude of benefit related to these interventions for persons without obesity who do not have hypertension, dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, or diabetes is positive but small. The potential harms are at most small, leading the USPSTF to conclude that these interventions have a small net benefit for this population.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 29, 2016, to January 2, 2017. A small number of comments were received, and all were reviewed by the USPSTF. A few respondents encouraged the USPSTF to issue separate recommendations for behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and interventions to promote physical activity. Other respondents felt that the evidence base was different for the 2 types of behavioral counseling interventions and suggested that the USPSTF assign separate and different grades. The USPSTF carefully reviewed the evidence on interventions that promoted a healthful diet only, those that promoted physical activity only, and those that promoted both. The USPSTF recognizes that the evidence base for these interventions varies, and although the evidence for behavior change was greater for interventions focusing on physical activity, there were no meaningful differences in intermediate or overall health outcomes. After reviewing the evidence, the USPSTF reaffirmed its conclusion that there is a positive but small benefit of behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet, physical activity, or both in persons who do not have CVD risk factors. Patients and health care professionals can decide together, based on patient interest and the availability of local resources, whether a focus on a healthful diet, physical activity, or both is most appropriate. Several comments agreed with the USPSTF's inclusion of language reinforcing the established benefits of healthful lifestyle behaviors and encouraged better definition of the nature of behavioral counseling interventions. The USPSTF retained its emphasis that all patients can gain health benefits from a healthful diet and appropriate physical activity and added language defining both. The USPSTF also clarified that the recommended behavioral counseling interventions are more intensive than just general promotion of a healthful diet and physical activity.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>One of the most important causes of vision abnormalities in children is amblyopia (also known as &ldquo;lazy eye&rdquo;). Amblyopia is an alteration in the visual neural pathway in a child&rsquo;s developing brain that can lead to permanent vision loss in the affected eye.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;It usually occurs in 1 eye but can occur in both. Risk factors associated with the development of amblyopia include strabismus (ocular misalignment); vision deprivation caused by media opacity (eg, cataracts); high, uncorrected refractive errors (eg, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism); and anisometropia (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#table1\">Table 1</a>). Other common causes of vision abnormalities are nonamblyopic strabismus and nonamblyopic refractive error.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>Among children younger than 6 years, 1% to 6% have amblyopia or its risk factors (strabismus, anisometropia, or both), which, if left untreated, could lead to amblyopia.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation3\">3-7</a></sup>&nbsp;Early identification of vision abnormalities could prevent the development of amblyopia.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vision screening tools are accurate in detecting vision abnormalities, including refractive errors, strabismus, and amblyopia. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to compare screening accuracy across age groups (</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children aged 3 to 5 years leads to improved visual acuity. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of improvement in visual acuity is of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that treatment reduced the incidence of long-term amblyopia or improved school performance, functioning, or quality of life. Limited evidence suggests that screening can potentially reduce psychosocial harms. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years leads to improved vision outcomes (ie, visual acuity) or other benefits.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to assess harms of vision screening tests in children aged 3 to 5 years, including higher false-positive rates in low-prevalence populations. False-positive screening results may lead to overdiagnosis or unnecessary treatment. Limited evidence suggests that eye patching in children aged 3 to 5 years does not worsen visual acuity in the nonamblyopic eye but may be associated with psychological harms, such as child or parental upset or concern. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of vision screening and treatment in children aged 3 to 5 years as small, based on the nature of the interventions. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment in children younger than 3 years.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that vision screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children aged 3 to 5 years has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of vision screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years are uncertain, and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined for this age group.</p>",

Younger children (&lt;3 years) are often unable to cooperate with some of the clinical screening tests performed in clinical practice, such as visual acuity testing, which may result in false-positive results. Some clinical practice guidelines now recommend using handheld autorefractors and photoscreeners as alternative approaches to screening in children 6 months and older because of improved child cooperation and improved accuracy.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation28\">28</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>One potential disadvantage of using some types of photoscreeners is the need for external interpretation of screening results.

Well-designed trials are needed to better understand the effects of screening vs no screening, the optimal age for initiation of screening, and appropriate screening intervals. Additional studies are needed to determine the best screening approach and most favorable combinations of screening tests in primary care. There is also a need for studies that examine the benefits and harms of vision screening and treatment in children younger than 3 years and the long-term benefits and harms of preschool vision screening on health outcomes, such as quality of life, school performance, developmental trajectory, and functioning.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><em>Recommendations of Others</em></h3>\r\n<p>In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, American Academy of Certified Orthoptists, and American Academy of Ophthalmology released a joint clinical report recommending preschool vision screening.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation41\">41</a></sup>The joint report recommends vision assessment in children aged 6 months to 3 years with physical examination (eg, external inspection, the fixation and follow test, the red reflex test, and pupil examination).

Testability was reported in many of the included studies; however, few reported data stratified by age or for children younger than 3 years. Testability generally exceeded 80% to 90% in children aged 3 years, with small increases through age 5 years. Studies that evaluated testability found better testability rates in older children (&ge;3 years); visual acuity and stereoacuity tests had low testability rates in children younger than 3 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Some data suggest that photoscreeners have high testability rates in children as young as 1 year.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The VIP study found testability rates near 100% (in children aged &ge;3 years) for autorefractors and photoscreeners.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening#citation33\">33</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No eligible randomized clinical trials directly compared screening vs no screening.

Accuracy did not clearly differ among preschool-aged children by age group. Treatment of amblyopia is associated with moderate improvements in visual acuity in children aged 3 to 5 years, which are likely to result in permanent improvements throughout life. The USPSTF concluded that the benefits are moderate because untreated amblyopia results in permanent, uncorrectable vision loss, and the benefits of screening and treatment can be experienced over a child&rsquo;s lifetime. The USPSTF found adequate evidence on harms of screening (ie, higher false-positive rates in low-prevalence populations). The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of treatment as small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate for children aged 3 to 5 years.</p>\r\n<p>Trials that examined the benefits and harms of treatment did not enroll children younger than 3 years. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years leads to improved vision outcomes or other benefits. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment in children younger than 3 years. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years are uncertain, and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined for this age group.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Amblyopia is a functional reduction in visual acuity characterized by abnormal processing of visual images by the brain. It is associated with conditions that affect binocular vision, such as strabismus, anisometropia, and media opacity. The loss in visual acuity is unlikely to resolve spontaneously if left untreated. Therefore, screening in preschool-aged children seems to be consistent with the current biological understanding of amblyopia and the importance of detecting it during a critical period in children&rsquo;s development.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 28 to March 27, 2017. Some comments expressed concern about the scope of the review for screening. The USPSTF added language to clarify that the general eye examination to detect ocular abnormalities was not in scope for this review, and further clarified the language about screening tests in the Clinical Considerations section. Other comments expressed concern about the lack of information on health disparities. In response, the USPSTF added language about health disparities to the Clinical Considerations section. Some comments did not agree with delaying screening until the age of 3 years. The USPSTF added more language about the lack of evidence regarding screening and treatment in children younger than 3 years to the Discussion section. Last, some comments requested information about the effects of screening on learning and quality of life outcomes. The USPSTF revised the Research Needs and Gaps section, which discusses these gaps in the evidence on outcomes.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of a woman&rsquo;s menstrual cycle. It is typically defined in retrospect, 12 months after a woman&rsquo;s final menstrual period. Menopause occurs at a median age of 51.3 years, and the average US woman who reaches menopause is expected to live another 30 years. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic conditions, such as coronary heart disease, dementia, stroke, fractures, and breast cancer, increase with age; however, the excess risk for these conditions that can be attributed to menopause alone is uncertain. Since the publication of findings from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI) that hormone therapy use was associated with serious adverse health effects in postmenopausal women, use of menopausal hormone therapy has declined, from 44% of US women using or having used hormone therapy in 1988&ndash;1994 to 4.7% of women in 2010.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<h4>Combined Estrogen and Progestin</h4>\r\n<p>Many health outcomes potentially associated with the use of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women have been examined. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that use of combined estrogen and progestin has a moderate benefit in reducing the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women and adequate evidence that it has a small benefit in reducing the risk of diabetes.</p>\r\n<h4>Estrogen Alone</h4>\r\n<p>The use of estrogen without progestin has generally been restricted to women who have had a hysterectomy, because unopposed estrogen use increases the risk of endometrial cancer in women with an intact uterus. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that use of estrogen alone has a moderate benefit in reducing the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the use of estrogen alone has a moderate benefit in reducing the risk of developing or dying of invasive breast cancer and a small benefit in reducing the risk of diabetes. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that estrogen use does not have a beneficial effect on risk of coronary heart disease.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<h4>Combined Estrogen and Progestin</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that use of combined estrogen and progestin is associated with moderate harms, including increased risk of invasive breast cancer and venous thromboembolism, and a small to moderate harm of increased risk of coronary heart disease. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence of other moderate harms, such as increased risk of stroke, dementia, gallbladder disease, and urinary incontinence.</p>\r\n<h4>Estrogen Alone</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of estrogen alone is associated with moderate harms, including increased risk of stroke, dementia, gallbladder disease, urinary incontinence, and venous thromboembolism.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of combined estrogen and progestin has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in most postmenopausal women with an intact uterus.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of estrogen alone has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in most postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation statement applies to asymptomatic, postmenopausal women who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions. It does not apply to women who are considering hormone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness. It also does not apply to women who have had premature menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency) or surgical menopause.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation statement applies to an average-risk population. Risk factors for a specific chronic condition or individual characteristics that affect the likelihood of experiencing a specific therapy-associated adverse event may cause a woman&rsquo;s net balance of benefits and harms to differ from that of the average population.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Menopausal hormone therapy refers to the use of combined estrogen and progestin in women with an intact uterus, or estrogen alone in women who have had a hysterectomy, taken at or after the time of menopause. For this recommendation, the USPSTF considered evidence on the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) menopausal hormone therapy but not local formulations (eg, creams or rings) of hormone therapy, because these are not generally used for the primary prevention of chronic conditions.</p>\r\n<p>Indications for hormone therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in menopausal women are limited to the treatment of menopausal symptoms and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. An FDA-issued black box warning indicates that estrogen therapy, with or without progestin, should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with the patient&rsquo;s treatment goals and risks.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Several different formulations of menopausal hormone therapy are approved by the FDA for use in the United States; the specific formulation used in the WHI trial, the largest trial reviewed by the USPSTF, was 0.625 mg/d of oral conjugated equine estrogens, with or without 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Currently, evidence to determine whether different types, doses, or modes of delivery of hormone therapy affect its benefit-to-harm profile for the prevention of chronic conditions is limited.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The use of menopausal hormone therapy is associated with both benefits and harms. Combined estrogen and progestin use is associated with a decreased risk of fractures, diabetes, and colorectal cancer; however, it is also associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer, coronary heart disease, thromboembolic events, stroke, dementia, gallbladder disease, and self-reported urinary incontinence. Estrogen use alone is associated with a decreased risk of fractures, invasive breast cancer, and diabetes; however, it is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, stroke, dementia, gallbladder disease, and self-reported urinary incontinence. The reason for the discordant effect of estrogen alone compared with combined estrogen and progestin on the risk of invasive breast cancer is unclear.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#tab1\">Table 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#tab2\">Table 2</a>&nbsp;show the estimated absolute event rate differences associated with the use of combined estrogen and progestin and estrogen alone, compared with placebo, for these health outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>Several interventions and preventive medications to reduce the risk of chronic conditions in women have been studied. For example, the use of medications such as tamoxifen and raloxifene in women at increased risk of breast cancer who do not have contraindications and are at low risk of adverse medication effects is a potential strategy to reduce risk of breast cancer.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults who are overweight or obese and have additional cardiovascular disease risk factors.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF also recommends daily use of low-dose aspirin to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease in appropriate candidates.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation5\">5</a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<h3><strong>Other Considerations</strong></h3>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence is limited whether the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy vary by age, race/ethnicity, or timing of initiation after menopause. In the WHI trial, the test for trend by age group showed a statistically significant trend toward lower all-cause mortality among younger women (aged 50 to 59 years at time of randomization) assigned to estrogen alone but not women assigned to combined estrogen and progestin. There is no evidence that women of different races/ethnicities experience a different balance of benefits and harms with menopausal hormone therapy; however, the majority (approximately 80%) of women in the largest trial (WHI) where white, so these analyses may be underpowered to detect such differences. Data regarding whether the timing of initiation of hormone therapy after menopause affects the balance of benefits and harms are conflicting. A meta-analysis of individual-patient data may be helpful to determine whether the balance of benefits and harms of hormone therapy is different in any of these subgroups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n<p>As in its 2012 recommendation on the use of menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions, the USPSTF continues to recommend against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and against the use of estrogen alone in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The American Heart Association<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation33\">33</a></sup>&nbsp;and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation34\">34</a></sup>&nbsp;recommend against the use of hormone therapy for the primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, and most clinical guidelines, including those of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation35\">35</a></sup>&nbsp;and the American Academy of Family Physicians,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation36\">36</a></sup>&nbsp;recommend against the use of hormone therapy for prevention of any chronic conditions.

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, heart disease is the leading cause of death among women in the United States; in 2013, 289,758 women died from the disease.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2014, there were more than 267,000 hospitalizations for hip fractures among persons 65 years and older, and overall, 69% of hip fractures occur in women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;By 2025, the estimated annual incidence and costs of fractures in the United States will increase by 50%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation10\">10</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence about the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and whether outcomes vary among women in different subgroups or by timing of intervention after menopause. The use of hormone therapy, whether administered orally, transdermally, or locally for the treatment of menopausal symptoms (eg, vasomotor hot flashes or vulvovaginal symptoms) or for other indications is outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits and Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 18 fair- or good-quality trials comparing the effects of combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone vs placebo on the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Of these trials, the WHI trial was the largest and was the only trial designed and sufficiently powered to evaluate the effectiveness of hormone therapy for primary prevention of the multiple conditions that are the focus of this recommendation statement.</p>\r\n<p>The WHI trial compared 0.625 mg/d of oral conjugated equine estrogens, both with and without 2.5 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate, vs placebo. Other trials used a variety of estrogenic agents (conjugated equine estrogens, estradiol, or transdermal estradiol) and progestogens (medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone, or micronized progesterone) as active study agents. The WHI trial enrolled women aged 50 to 79 years; the average age was 63 years.</p>\r\n<p>The WHI trial provided most of the estimates used to assess the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy. Including the posttrial phases, the WHI trial had up to 13 years of follow-up to assess how risks for chronic conditions changed after women stopped hormone therapy. Data on the effects of menopausal hormone therapy on the risk of chronic conditions for all relevant studies are presented below. Where possible, trial data were combined in a meta-analysis. If this was not possible, trial data are discussed separately.</p>\r\n<h4>Coronary Heart Disease</h4>\r\n<p>Observational evidence has suggested that there might be a protective effect of menopausal hormone therapy on coronary heart disease; however, the WHI and other trials have not demonstrated such an effect. Pooled results of 3 trials reporting on the risk of coronary heart disease in women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo (N=18,081) showed a higher risk of coronary events in women who took hormone therapy (relative risk [RR], 1.23 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.52]) during a mean follow-up of 5 years; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Postintervention follow-up of women in the WHI trial showed that 2.4 years after stopping combined estrogen and progestin, risk of coronary heart disease was not significantly different between women who took hormone therapy during the trial and those who received placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89 to 1.21]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation11\">11</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Pooled results of 3 trials reporting on the risk of coronary heart disease in women randomized to estrogen alone vs placebo (N=11,310) showed no statistically significant difference in risk of coronary events between women who took estrogen therapy and those who received placebo (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.14]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Postintervention follow-up of women in the WHI trial showed that 3.9 years after stopping estrogen alone, risk of coronary heart disease was similar between women who took hormone therapy during the trial and those who received placebo (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.25]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation12\">12</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Breast Cancer</h4>\r\n<p>Because estrogen generally stimulates breast cell proliferation, trials of menopausal hormone therapy have reported on the risk of breast cancer as one of the primary adverse outcomes of treatment. Six trials comparing combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo reported on breast cancer incidence. However, only 2 of these trials followed up women for more than 4 years, and only the WHI trial reported on the risk of invasive breast cancer (vs any breast cancer).</p>\r\n<p>During the intervention phase of the WHI trial (median duration, 5.6 years), women assigned to combined estrogen and progestin had a significantly increased risk of invasive breast cancer vs women assigned to placebo (HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.53]). The risk remained significantly increased during a median postintervention follow-up of 8.2 years (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.61]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;In the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), more women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin developed breast cancer during the 4.1-year intervention phase than did women who received placebo, but the results were not statistically significant (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 0.82 to 2.31]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In 3 smaller trials (the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis [ERA],<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation15\">15</a></sup>&nbsp;Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions [PEPI],<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation16\">16</a></sup>and Estonian Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy [EPHT]<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;trials), the risk of breast cancer incidence was not significantly different between women randomized to receive combined estrogen and progestin and those who received placebo over 3 to 4 years; however, few cases occurred overall. The fourth trial, the Women&rsquo;s International Study of Long Duration Estrogen After Menopause (WISDOM), was stopped after 1 year because of the WHI results indicating excess breast cancer risk in women receiving combined estrogen and progestin; breast cancer incidence was not significantly different between groups at 1 year.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation18\">18</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Five trials comparing estrogen alone vs placebo reported on breast cancer incidence; however, only the WHI trial reported on risk of invasive breast cancer. In the WHI trial, women assigned to estrogen alone had a nonsignificant decrease in risk of invasive breast cancer vs women assigned to placebo during the median 7.2-year intervention phase (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.02]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation12\">12</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;The risk remained lower during the median 6.6-year postintervention phase after the trial had been stopped. The difference between groups was statistically significant during cumulative follow-up (includes trial and postintervention phase; median duration, 13 years) (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation13\">13</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In the Estrogen for the Prevention of Re-Infarction Trial (ESPRIT), the risk of breast cancer was not significantly different between women randomized to estrogen alone and those receiving placebo during the 2-year intervention period (RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.25 to 3.91]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;In the ERA trial,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation15\">15</a></sup>&nbsp;PEPI trial,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation16\">16</a></sup>&nbsp;and Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial (EPAT),<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;there were few cases of breast cancer, and the results were inconclusive.</p>\r\n<h4>Thromboembolic Events</h4>\r\n<p>In the WHI trial, women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin had an increased risk of pulmonary embolism (HR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.36 to 2.87]) and deep vein thrombosis (HR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.37 to 2.54]) vs women randomized to placebo over a median follow-up of 5.6 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;There was no significant difference between groups in risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during the 2.4-year postintervention period.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation11\">11</a></sup>&nbsp;Women randomized to estrogen alone had an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis during the mean 7.1-year intervention phase (HR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.06 to 2.07]); the risk of pulmonary embolism was not significantly higher than in the placebo group (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.89 to 2.05]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;There was no significant difference between groups in risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during the 3.9-year postintervention period.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation12\">12</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In 3 smaller trials (ERA,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation15\">15</a></sup>&nbsp;EPHT,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;and the Estrogen Memory Study [EMS]<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation21\">21</a></sup>) of combined estrogen and progestin, which varied in study duration and outcome measures, there was no significant difference in risk of venous thromboembolism between women randomized to hormone therapy vs placebo over 2 to 3 years; however, the number of events was small. One trial of estrogen alone (EPAT<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation20\">20</a></sup>) reported no venous thromboembolic events in either group during 2 years of follow-up.</p>\r\n<h4>Stroke</h4>\r\n<p>In the WHI trial, women who took combined estrogen and progestin had a significantly higher risk of stroke vs those who received placebo during the intervention phase (median duration, 5.6 years; HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.76]); during postintervention follow-up, stroke risk was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.26]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation13\">13</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Two other trials comparing combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo reported on the incidence of various cerebrovascular events.

WHIMS and the WHIMS estrogen-only trial evaluated the risk of probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment in women taking combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone vs placebo. Both studies were subsets of the WHI trial and were limited to women aged 65 to 79 years at baseline who were free of probable dementia. Women who took combined estrogen and progestin had a higher risk of probable dementia than those who received placebo (HR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48]) but not mild cognitive impairment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation22\">22</a></sup>&nbsp;Women who took estrogen alone had a higher risk of the composite outcome measure (probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment) (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.89]) but not probable dementia alone.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation23\">23</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Gallbladder Disease</h4>\r\n<p>In the WHI trial, women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone had an increased risk of gallbladder disease (HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.28 to 1.97] and HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.35 to 2.06], respectively).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;Risk of gallbladder disease in the combined estrogen and progestin group decreased postintervention but continued to be greater in the hormone therapy group than in the placebo group (median duration, 8.2 years; HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.52]); risk of gallbladder disease was no longer significantly different at 6.6 years postintervention in the estrogen-alone group (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.41]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation13\">13</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Urinary Incontinence</h4>\r\n<p>Both the WHI trial and HERS showed a consistently higher risk of self-reported incident urinary incontinence at all time points in women who took combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo. In the WHI trial, women who took combined estrogen and progestin had a higher risk of incontinence at 1 year (RR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.52]) and at 3 years (RR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.16 to 2.84]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;In HERS, women who took combined estrogen and progestin had a higher risk of incontinence at the 4.2-year follow-up (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3 to 1.9]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation26\">26</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Two trials, WHI<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;and Ultra Low Dose Transdermal Estrogen Assessment (ULTRA),<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation27\">27</a></sup>&nbsp;provided data on self-reported incident urinary incontinence in women who took estrogen alone vs placebo.

Similarly, pooled results of 3 trials reporting all-cause mortality in women randomized to estrogen alone vs placebo (N=11,961) showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.17]) during a mean follow-up of 6.8 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;A recent WHI analysis showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.08]) or estrogen alone (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.01]) vs placebo during 18 years of cumulative follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation31\">31</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Subgroups of Interest</h3>\r\n<p>Subgroups of interest for this recommendation statement include women grouped according to race/ethnicity; age; duration of hormone therapy use; type, dose, and mode of delivery of hormone therapy; and presence of comorbid conditions.</p>\r\n<p>Trials did not report results for most of these subgroups. Subgroup analyses were limited to those based on race/ethnicity, age, and a small number of comorbid conditions or risk factors. For most outcomes, there were no statistically significant subgroup effects; however, studies may have been underpowered to detect such effects.</p>\r\n<p>In the WHI estrogen-alone trial, statistically significant interactions between age and the risk of all-cause mortality, colorectal cancer, and myocardial infarction, though not total coronary heart disease events, were detected. There were significant trends toward lower risks of these outcomes in younger women (50 to 59 years) and higher risks in older women (70 to 79 years) randomized to estrogen alone relative to placebo.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;However, the multiplicity of outcomes and subgroup comparisons conducted (in these analyses,&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;values for trend by age group were not adjusted for the large number of tests conducted), as well as the small number of events that occurred for some of these outcomes in the estrogen-alone trial subgroups, limit the strength of these findings. These limitations, along with the absence of significant subgroup effects for most outcomes, led the USPSTF to conclude that the evidence was inadequate to determine that any subgroup had a different balance of benefits and harms.</p>\r\n<p>To date, evidence to determine whether different types, doses, or modes of delivery of hormone therapy have a different balance of benefits and harms is limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Timing of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>It has been proposed that hormone therapy initiated closer to the time of menopause may have a more beneficial, or less deleterious, effect on risk of coronary heart disease (and possibly other health outcomes) than hormone therapy initiated later; this proposal has been termed the timing hypothesis. Findings from post hoc subgroup analyses of the WHI trial regarding the effect of timing of hormone therapy initiation on the risk of coronary events are conflicting. In 1 subgroup analysis, women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin within 10 years of menopause did not have the increased risk of coronary heart disease observed in women randomized to hormone therapy more than 20 years postmenopause; however, there was also no beneficial effect in the former group. In contrast, a second subgroup analysis that considered prior hormone therapy use (ie, before trial enrollment), which provides a more accurate assessment of the time between menopause and initiation of hormone therapy, found no difference in coronary risk between early (&lt;5 years) vs late (&ge;5 years) initiation of hormone therapy. It is important to note that all such post hoc analyses should be considered exploratory (hypothesis forming) and not confirmatory in nature, and are also subject to potential bias.</p>\r\n<p>To date, no good-quality randomized trials have prospectively evaluated the effect of timing of hormone therapy initiation relative to the onset of menopause on associated benefits and harms.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Although the use of hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal women is associated with some benefits, there are also well-documented harms. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of both the benefits and the harms of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women is small to moderate. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that combined estrogen and progestin has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in most postmenopausal women with an intact uterus and that estrogen alone has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in most postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Traditionally, estrogen has been viewed as having cardioprotective effects. The incidence of coronary heart disease in premenopausal women is lower than in men of the same age; this difference decreases as women age past menopause. Estrogen decreases levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increases levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and has a vasodilator effect. Despite these observations, data from randomized clinical trials show a lack of benefit, or even a harmful effect, of hormone therapy on risk of coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women. Several potential factors, including timing of initiation of hormone therapy with respect to menopause, older age, and presence of atheroma, have been proposed to account for these discrepant findings. Nonetheless, the underlying causes of this lack of benefit are uncertain.</p>\r\n<p>Another discrepant finding is that combined estrogen and progestin is associated with a small increase in the risk of breast cancer, while estrogen alone appears to slightly reduce this risk. Although estrogen generally stimulates breast cell proliferation, some preclinical studies have shown that estrogen can induce breast cell apoptosis if administered under conditions of estrogen deprivation, and that progestin can stimulate breast cell proliferation and formation of new blood vessels. These findings have been proposed as a possible explanation for the apparent discrepant effects of combined estrogen and progestin and estrogen alone on breast cancer risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation32\">32</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 16 to June 12, 2017. In response to public comment, the USPSTF modified the title of the recommendation statement to clarify that the patient population under consideration consists of postmenopausal women. The USPSTF clarified that it reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of systemic menopausal hormone therapy (ie, administered orally or transdermally), not local hormone therapy (eg, creams or rings). The USPSTF also provided additional details about the WHI trial, specifying the formulation of hormone therapy used and the average age of women enrolled in the trial. The USPSTF added 2 tables showing the absolute risk increase or decrease of various health outcomes in women receiving combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#tab1\">Table 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#tab2\">Table 2</a>).</p>\r\n<p>In response to comments that some subgroups of women (eg, women aged 50 to 59 years taking estrogen alone) experience a more beneficial balance of benefits and harms than the overall group of women in the WHI trial, the USPSTF expanded its discussion on the interaction between age and health outcomes in the WHI trial in the &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo; section. The USPSTF also clarified that the WHI analyses that assessed whether time between menopause and initiation of hormone therapy affects the benefits and harms of hormone therapy were conducted post hoc.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF added the word &ldquo;primary&rdquo; to the recommendation summary to further highlight that this recommendation statement focuses on the use of hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women, not on its use for the treatment of vasomotor, vulvovaginal, or other symptoms. The USPSTF is tasked with evaluating the benefits and harms of clinical preventive services in generally asymptomatic populations; therefore, the treatment of symptoms is outside of its purview.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF agrees with comments regarding the importance of individualized and shared decision making, and states so in the preamble to each recommendation statement. Last, the USPSTF clarified the definition of menopause in the &ldquo;Rationale&rdquo; section and added a reference to the Endocrine Society&rsquo;s guidelines on hormone therapy in the &ldquo;Recommendations of Others&rdquo; section.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine of unknown cause with a Cobb angle (a measure of the curvature of the spine) of at least 10&deg; that occurs in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. It is the most common form of scoliosis and usually worsens during adolescence before skeletal maturity. In the United States, the estimated prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with a Cobb angle of at least 10&deg; among children and adolescents aged 10 to 16 years is 1% to 3%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup></span> Most patients with a spinal curvature of greater than 40&deg; at skeletal maturity will likely experience curvature progression in adulthood. Severe spinal curvature may be associated with adverse long-term health outcomes (eg, pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and reduced quality of life).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup></span> Therefore, early identification and effective treatment of mild scoliosis could slow or stop curvature progression before skeletal maturity, thereby improving long-term outcomes in adulthood.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can accurately detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The accuracy of screening was highest (93.8% sensitivity and 99.2% specificity) when 3 separate screening tests were used (eg, the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moir&eacute; topography); sensitivity was lower when screening programs used just 1 or 2 screening tests (eg, 71.1% for the forward bend test and scoliometer measurement and 84.4% for the forward bend test alone).</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence regarding the effect of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on patient-centered health outcomes. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle &lt;50&deg; at diagnosis) in adolescents with exercise (2 small studies) or surgery (no studies) or its effects on health outcomes or the degree of spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood. The USPSTF found adequate evidence (5 studies) that treatment with bracing may decrease curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity (an intermediate outcome). However, it found inadequate evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the direct harms of screening, such as psychological harms or harms associated with confirmatory radiography. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of treatment.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cannot be determined.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. This recommendation does not apply to children and adolescents presenting for evaluation of back pain, breathing difficulties, abnormal radiography findings or other imaging studies, or obvious deformities in spinal curvature.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Most screening tests for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are noninvasive. Screening is usually done by visual inspection of the spine to look for asymmetry of the shoulders, shoulder blades, and hips. In the United States, the forward bend test is commonly used to screen for idiopathic scoliosis. First, a clinician visually inspects the spine of a patient while the patient is standing upright. Next, the patient stands with feet together and bends forward at the waist with arms hanging and palms touching. The clinician repeats the visual inspection of the spine.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></span> A scoliometer, which measures the angle of trunk rotation, may be used during the forward bend test. An angle of trunk rotation of 5&deg; to 7&deg; is often the threshold for referral for radiography.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> Other screening tests include a humpometer, the plumb line test, and Moir&eacute; topography (creating a 3-dimensional image of the surface of a patient&rsquo;s back) (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#tab\">Table</a>).</p>\r\n<p>If idiopathic scoliosis is suspected, radiography is used to confirm the diagnosis and to quantify the degree of curvature (ie, the Cobb angle) and the Risser sign (the stage of ossification of the iliac apophysis).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> US organizations that advocate screening recommend the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The goal of treatment is to decrease or stop progression of spinal curvature during the period of adolescent growth prior to skeletal maturity. Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is determined by the degree of spinal curvature and the potential for further growth and generally includes observation, bracing, surgery, and exercise.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Most children and adolescents with scoliosis do not have symptoms. Generally, smaller spinal curvatures remain stable, while larger curvatures tend to progress in severity.</p>\r\n<p>Pulmonary dysfunction can be clinically significant in patients with spinal curvatures greater than 100&deg;; however, curvatures of that severity are rare. Back pain is more common, but its effect on functioning or disability is unclear.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> Current evidence suggests that the presence of back pain does not necessarily correlate with the degree of spinal curvature in adulthood. Adults with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may have poor self-reported health, appearance, and social interactions. Mortality is similar to that among unaffected adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence on the harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is limited. False-positive results are an important potential harm, with rates ranging from 0.8% to 21.5%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation5\">5</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup></span> However, the direct harms of screening are unclear.

Patients with a Cobb angle greater than 30&deg; or a Cobb angle of 20&deg; to 30&deg; that progresses 5&deg; or more over 3 to 6 months are treated with bracing. Patients with a Cobb angle of 40&deg; to 50&deg; may be treated with bracing or surgery, while those with a Cobb angle greater than 50&deg; typically require surgery.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified several research gaps. Prospective, controlled screening studies that allow for comparison of screened and nonscreened populations and different screening settings, personnel, and procedures are needed. Good-quality studies with prospective identification of cohorts at the time of diagnosis (eg, from geographical areas with and without routine screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis) or treatment (eg, treated vs observed cohorts) for the purpose of long-term follow-up are important. High-quality studies on the potential harms of screening and treatment are also needed. Additional studies to help determine whether individual characteristics (eg, body mass index) may influence response to bracing treatment would be helpful. Studies on long-term outcomes are needed and should stratify results by degree of spinal curvature at diagnosis and at skeletal maturity. Better information on long-term outcomes such as pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and quality of life would be helpful. Good-quality studies on treatment with exercise, bracing, and surgery among screen-detected patients are needed. Studies conducted in primary care settings are also needed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>Several national specialty groups have published statements in support of screening. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the Scoliosis Research Society, the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics advocate screening for scoliosis in girls at 10 and 12 years and once in male adolescents at 13 or 14 years as part of medical home preventive services, if screening is performed by well-trained screening personnel.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation26\"><span>26</span></a></sup> The UK National Screening Society does not recommend screening for scoliosis, given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of screening and treatment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation27\"><span>27</span></a></sup> However, the International Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment recommends screening for idiopathic scoliosis through school-based programs, and that screening should be performed by clinicians who specialize in spinal deformities.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation28\"><span>28</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><sup><span>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</span></sup></strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation updates the 2004 USPSTF recommendation, in which the USPSTF recommended against routine screening for idiopathic scoliosis in asymptomatic adolescents (D recommendation).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup> In 2004, the USPSTF found fair evidence that treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis leads to health benefits (ie, decreased pain and disability) in a small proportion of persons. The USPSTF bounded the harms of treatment as moderate (eg, unnecessary brace wear or unnecessary referral to specialty care). Therefore, at that time, the USPSTF concluded that the harms of screening exceeded the potential benefits.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence. Because of new research, the USPSTF determined that it no longer has moderate certainty that the harms of treatment outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF found no direct evidence of a benefit of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on health outcomes. A growing body of evidence suggests that brace treatment can interrupt or slow scoliosis progression; however, evidence on whether reducing spinal curvature in adolescence has a long-term effect on health in adulthood is inadequate. Evidence on the effects of exercise and surgery on health or spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood is insufficient. Although the USPSTF previously found that treatment has moderate harms, a change in the analytic framework, outcomes, and applicability of older evidence resulted in the USPSTF assessing the evidence on harms of treatment as inadequate.

Potential harms associated with false-positive results include psychological harms, chest radiation, and other harms of unnecessary treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Potential harms of bracing include skin problems, body pain, physical limitations, anxiety, and depression. Complications of surgery include bleeding, infection, nerve damage, and death. The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the harms of treatment with surgery or exercise. Harms of bracing were reported in 1 good-quality study (n=242).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation17\"><span>17</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation18\">18</a></sup></span> In this RCT, intervention group participants were more likely to experience skin problems under the brace than control group participants (12/146 vs 0/96, respectively). Intervention group participants more commonly reported nonback body pain than control group participants (12/146 vs 2/96, respectively). The study reported low rates of anxiety and depression. Three of 146 participants in the intervention group reported anxiety and depression, compared with 1 of 96 participants in the control group. One of the intervention group participants reported a serious adverse event (anxiety and depression requiring hospitalization) compared with no participants in the control group. The intervention and control groups had similar rates of abnormal breast development, neurologic symptoms, and gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation17\"><span>17</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation18\">18</a></sup></span></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and health outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis but no evidence on the harms of screening. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on treatment with exercise and surgery; it found adequate evidence that treatment with bracing may slow curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity. However, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cannot be determined.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Mild or moderate idiopathic scoliosis (ie, Cobb angle of &lt;40&deg; to 50&deg;) is often asymptomatic in adolescence. In addition, the majority of cases of scoliosis will not substantially progress during adolescence. The likelihood of progression in adulthood is small for persons with a spinal curvature of less than 30&deg; at skeletal maturity. However, there is no validated way to easily identify which cases of asymptomatic scoliosis will worsen during adolescence and lead to poor long-term outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 30 to June 26, 2017. Many comments expressed concern about the change in letter grade (from a D grade to an I statement). In response, the USPSTF added language in the \"Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation\" section to explain the change in grade. Some comments sought clarification of who the recommendation applies to. The USPSTF clarified this in the &ldquo;Patient Population Under Consideration&rdquo; section. Other comments expressed concern that the evidence needed to change the recommendation grade is unattainable. The USPSTF added language to address this in the &ldquo;Research Needs and Gaps&rdquo; section.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>The age-adjusted incidence of ovarian cancer from 2010 to 2014 was 11.4 cases per 100,000 women per year.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among US women and the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer, despite its low incidence.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> Approximately 14,000 women die of ovarian cancer each year in the United States. More than 95% of ovarian cancer deaths occur among women 45 years and older.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The positive predictive value of screening tests for ovarian cancer is low, and most women with a positive screening test result do not have ovarian cancer (ie, many women without ovarian cancer will have a false-positive result on screening tests).</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening with transvaginal ultrasound, testing for the serum tumor marker cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), or a combination of both does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer can result in important harms, including many false-positive results, which can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions in women who do not have cancer. Depending on the type of screening test used, the magnitude of harm ranges from moderate to substantial and reflects the risk for unnecessary diagnostic surgery. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the psychological harms of screening for ovarian cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is at least moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefits.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who are not known to have a high-risk hereditary cancer syndrome. A hereditary cancer syndrome occurs when a genetic mutation is passed from parent to child that increases risk for developing cancers or can cause earlier onset of cancers. Women who have a hereditary cancer syndrome that puts them at high risk for ovarian cancer are excluded from this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Women with certain hereditary cancer syndromes are at high risk for ovarian cancer. For example, women with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are at high risk for ovarian cancer. Numerous genetic mutations and hereditary cancer syndromes may be associated with ovarian cancer, each with a different constellation of associated cancers and family history pattern.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3-5</span></a></sup> Women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer may be at risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome and should discuss their family history with their health care professional. Management of a diagnosed hereditary cancer syndrome and prevention of ovarian cancer in these women is beyond the scope of this recommendation statement.</p>\r\n<p>The clinical symptoms of ovarian cancer (eg, abdominal pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back pain, or fatigue) are nonspecific and may be present in both healthy women and women with late-stage ovarian cancer; therefore, use of clinical symptoms for risk stratification for the early detection of disease is difficult.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for ovarian cancer using any method. Transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 testing are readily available procedures that are commonly used to evaluate women with signs or symptoms of ovarian cancer, and both have been evaluated in screening studies. Pelvic examination is also commonly performed to evaluate women with lower abdominal symptoms, and although many clinicians perceive that pelvic examination with bimanual palpation of the ovaries is useful for screening for ovarian cancer,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> there is a lack of evidence to support this.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation7\"><span>7</span></a></sup> Furthermore, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial included bimanual palpation of the ovaries in its initial screening protocol, but this screening component was discontinued 5 years into the study because no cases of ovarian cancer were detected solely with bimanual palpation of the ovaries.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation9\">9</a></sup></span></p>\r\n<p>The evaluation of abnormal test results consists of repeat testing with the same or a different test and often surgical removal (by laparoscopy or laparotomy) of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes to determine whether a woman has ovarian cancer. Diagnostic guidelines recommend surgical removal of the complete ovary or ovaries, rather than tissue biopsy, to determine whether ovarian cancer is present.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of ovarian cancer typically includes surgical treatment (staging or debulking) and intraperitoneal, intravenous, or combined chemotherapy.</p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>In a separate recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommends that women with a family history indicating they are at risk for a deleterious gene mutation (<em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>) be referred for genetic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation10\"><span>10</span></a></sup> The National Cancer Institute provides additional information on ovarian cancer risk and hereditary cancer syndromes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation11\"><span>11</span></a></sup> The USPSTF also concluded in a separate recommendation statement that the current evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with pelvic examination to detect a range of gynecologic conditions in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation7\"><span>7</span></a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Given that most cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed at later stages, when associated mortality is high, further research is needed to identify new screening strategies that could accurately detect ovarian cancer early, at a point when outcomes could be improved. There is a need for more sensitive and specific serologic tests, as well as better imaging techniques. Because of the potential for serious harms from diagnostic workup of positive screening results (ie, surgical removal of the ovary to determine whether ovarian cancer is present), new screening strategies should minimize false-positive results and be highly specific. In addition, studies evaluating the benefits and harms of these screening strategies in asymptomatic women not at high risk for ovarian cancer are needed. Study outcomes should include ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery rate, surgical complication rate, and psychological harms. Further research is also needed on primary prevention of ovarian cancer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendation of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is consensus among major medical and public health organizations that screening for ovarian cancer in the general population is not recommended. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in low-risk, asymptomatic women; evaluation of high-risk women may include transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 testing, in addition to physical examination.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation22\"><span>22</span></a></sup> The American Cancer Society states that there is no screening test proven to be effective and sufficiently accurate in the early detection of ovarian cancer and does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation23\"><span>23</span></a></sup> The American College of Radiology does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation24\"><span>24</span></a></sup> Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation25\"><span>25</span></a></sup> Although it is beyond the scope of the USPSTF recommendation, other organizations, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, have issued guidelines for the prevention of ovarian cancer in women with hereditary cancer syndromes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation26\"><span>26</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>\r\n<p><span>This recommendation statement is consistent with the 2012 USPSTF recommendation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation21\"><span>21</span></a></sup> Since 2012, the large UKCTOCS trial was published, and much like the PLCO trial, it did not find that screening for ovarian cancer reduces ovarian cancer mortality in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer.</span></p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Based on United States Cancer Statistics data on invasive cancer rates from 2010 to 2014, the average annual age-adjusted incidence of ovarian cancer was 11.4 cases per 100,000 women per year, with a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 100,000 women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> In 2017, it is estimated that 22,440 new cases of ovarian cancer will have been diagnosed in the United States and 14,080 deaths will have occurred.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation12\"><span>12</span></a></sup> Early stages of the disease are often asymptomatic. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and can include abdominal pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back pain, or fatigue.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation13\"><span>13</span></a></sup> The majority of women (88%) diagnosed with ovarian cancer are 45 years and older, with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup> Most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at later stages; approximately 60% of women have distant spread of disease at the time of diagnosis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup> From 2010 to 2014, white women had the highest age-adjusted incidence rate (11.8 cases per 100,000 women), followed by Hispanic women (10.3 cases per 100,000 women), black women (9.2 cases per 100,000 women), Asian/Pacific Islander women (9.1 cases per 100,000 women), and American Indian/Alaska Native women (8.3 cases per 100,000 women). White women are most likely to die of ovarian cancer, followed by black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native women, and Asian/Pacific Islander women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Mortality rates from ovarian cancer vary by stage at diagnosis; 5-year survival rates range from 92.5% for localized cancer to 28.9% for cancer with distant spread.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation14\"><span>14</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for ovarian cancer to update its 2012 recommendation. The evidence review evaluated the benefits and harms of screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. Outcomes of interest included ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery and surgical complication rates, and psychological effects of screening. The USPSTF included primary peritoneal cancer in its ascertainment of ovarian cancer outcomes, even if it was not the primary end point of the study, because clinically, both types of cancer are diagnosed and treated as 1 disease. The USPSTF also considered ascertainment of ovarian cancer outcomes that included both incident and prevalent cases of cancer, since screening programs would detect both. The review included any screening approach evaluated by clinical trial design. The USPSTF considered the initial screening test (eg, transvaginal ultrasound or CA-125 testing interpreted using a single cutoff or the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm [ROCA; Abcodia Inc]) as the screening intervention. Further testing that subsequently occurred based on initial screening test results was considered follow-up testing and evaluation, rather than part of screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed direct evidence evaluating the benefits of screening for ovarian cancer on mortality.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> The USPSTF identified 3 good-quality studies evaluating the effect of annual screening in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. None of the studies found that screening significantly reduced ovarian cancer mortality. The largest and most recent trial, the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), was a randomized clinical trial of 202,638 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 74 years not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation15\"><span>15</span></a></sup> More than 95% of trial participants were white, and 1.6% reported a maternal history of ovarian cancer and 6.4% reported a maternal history of breast cancer; however, women with a family history considered &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; for familial ovarian cancer were explicitly excluded.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation16\"><span>16</span></a></sup> The UKCTOCS trial had 2 intervention groups and a no-screening control group. Women were randomized to screening with CA-125 serum testing, with triage and follow-up determined by ROCA, or to yearly transvaginal ultrasound. The CA-125 ROCA screening intervention group was described as multimodal screening in the trial publications and included a standard protocol for all additional evaluation. ROCA evaluates changes in CA-125 values over time, following a baseline age-adjusted measurement. Women randomized to the control group received no screening. After a median follow-up of 11.1 years, ovarian cancer mortality (which includes mortality from primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer) was not significantly different among the control group and 2 intervention groupss (0.35% in the control group, 0.32% in the transvaginal ultrasound group, and 0.32% in the CA-125 ROCA group). There was also no significant difference in mortality risk in the transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 ROCA groups (hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.09] and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.08], respectively).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation15\">15</a></sup></span> Exploratory analyses of UKCTOCS trial data suggest the potential for emergence of a delayed mortality benefit of screening appearing beyond 10 years from randomization. However, this finding was not statistically significant unless cases of primary peritoneal cancer were excluded. Extended follow-up data may help clarify this potential finding in the future; however, given the aggressive nature (ie, low 5-year survival rate) of ovarian cancer, the mechanism behind a delayed benefit from screening and early detection would be unclear, especially because the trial discontinued screening after 7 to 11 years.</p>\r\n<p>The pilot trial for the UKCTOCS trial, UK Pilot, was much smaller (n = 21,955 randomized). It evaluated the use of a single cutoff value for CA-125 testing and found no significant difference in ovarian cancer mortality (excluding cases of primary peritoneal cancer, which were not reported) between women who were screened vs not screened (0.08% vs 0.16%; relative risk, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.22 to 1.11]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation17\">17</a></sup></span></p>\r\n<p>The only trial conducted in the United States was the PLCO trial. In that trial, 68,557 women who had at least 1 ovary at baseline were randomized to either annual screening (both CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound for the first 4 rounds of screening, then 2 rounds of CA-125 testing only) or usual care; median follow-up was 12.4 years. Eligible participants were women aged 55 to 74 years without a previous diagnosis of lung, colorectal, or ovarian cancer. Trial recruitment targeted women from the general population; the trial did not actively exclude women based on risk for hereditary ovarian cancer syndromes (based on reported family history), and 17.4% of participants reported a family history of ovarian or breast cancer. Nearly 90% of participants were white. Abnormal test results were managed by the participant's personal health care practitioner. No difference was found in ovarian cancer mortality, which includes primary peritoneal cancer mortality, with 0.34% in the screening group and 0.29% in the usual care group (relative risk, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.71]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup></span> Recent analyses of PLCO trial data that add up to 6 more years of posttrial mortality data also did not find evidence of a longer-term benefit of screening.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation18\"><span>18</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence on harms of screening for ovarian cancer from the 3 studies described above, as well as a fourth study of fair quality reporting on quality of life and psychological harms of screening (Quality of life, Education, and Screening Trial [QUEST]) (n = 549 analyzed).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation19\"><span>19</span></a></sup> Based on data from the 3 studies, the calculated false-positive rates (ie, the number of women without cancer who had a positive screening test result) were 11.9% in the first screening round in the UKCTOCS transvaginal ultrasound group and 9.0% in the first screening round in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> These rates exclude cases of primary peritoneal cancer because this information was not reported. Cumulatively, in all subsequent screening rounds (ie, rounds 2 to 11) in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group, 44.2% of women who did not have ovarian cancer (including primary peritoneal cancer) had a positive CA-125 ROCA result at some point during the trial screening period.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> The false-positive rate for subsequent screening rounds in the UKCTOCS transvaginal ultrasound group was not reported. In the UK Pilot trial, the calculated false-positive rate (excluding cases of primary peritoneal cancer, which were not reported) of CA-125 testing using a single cutoff value was 4.2% across 3 screening rounds. In the PLCO trial, the calculated false-positive rate (including cases of primary peritoneal cancer) of transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 testing was 9.6% across all 6 screening rounds.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> Surgery to investigate positive screening test results among women who ultimately did not have ovarian cancer occurred in 0.2% of participants in the UK Pilot CA-125 group, 0.97% of participants in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group, 3.25% of participants in the UKCTOCS ultrasound group, and 3.17% of participants in the PLCO CA-125 plus ultrasound group.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> Up to 15% of these women had major surgical complications.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified limited evidence on the psychological harms of screening for ovarian cancer from the UKCTOCS and QUEST trials.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation19\">19</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation20\">20</a></sup></span> The UKCTOCS trial measured anxiety in a subgroup of participants.

Cancer screening consisted of alternating CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound every 6 months, for a maximum of 4 screening rounds. Although no statistically significant difference in cancer worry was found between study groups, the trial found that women with abnormal test results were more likely to report cancer worry at 2 years of follow-up (odds ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.1 to 7.2]) than women without abnormal results.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation19\"><span>19</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Three large good-quality studies all found no benefit in ovarian cancer mortality from annual screening in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence from these 3 studies that the harms from screening for ovarian cancer are at least moderate and may be substantial in some cases. Harms from screening for ovarian cancer include false-positive results, which may lead to unnecessary diagnostic surgery to determine whether ovarian cancer is present, often resulting in removal of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Serious surgical complications can also result. The USPSTF found the evidence on psychological harms of screening to be inadequate and could not draw any definitive conclusion on whether ovarian cancer screening causes psychological harms. Given the lack of mortality benefit of screening, and the moderate to substantial harms that could result from false-positive screening test results and subsequent surgery, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125 testing (using a single cutoff value or the ROCA), transvaginal ultrasound, or both outweigh the benefit, and the net balance of the benefit and harms of screening is negative.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 18, 2017, to August 14, 2017. Many comments voiced concern that given the aggressive nature of ovarian cancer and that symptoms often only appear at later stages, any screening test that can detect ovarian cancer early should be recommended. The USPSTF agrees that screening tests are needed that can accurately detect ovarian cancer earlier to prevent deaths from ovarian cancer; however, the evidence shows that currently available tests are not able to do so and can lead to harm by causing healthy women to undergo surgical removal of their ovaries when no cancer is present. The USPSTF issued its recommendation against screening based on this evidence, not on the costs of screening. Additional comments sought clarification on which women are at high risk for ovarian cancer and to whom the recommendation applies. The USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify the role of family history in ovarian cancer risk and to describe symptoms of ovarian cancer. Women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer or symptoms should discuss this with their health care provider. The USPSTF also provided more information on how it considered evidence from specific studies. The USPSTF considered study results that included cases of primary peritoneal cancer in the ascertainment of ovarian cancer because clinically, both types of cancer are diagnosed and treated as 1 disease. Similarly, the USPSTF considered study results that included reporting of both prevalent and incident cases of ovarian cancer, because screening would detect both.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States and is generally categorized as melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer. Melanoma is the fifth-leading type of incident cancer, and 2.2% of adults will be diagnosed with it in their lifetime.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> Although invasive melanoma accounts for 2% of all skin cancer cases, it is responsible for 80% of skin cancer deaths.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 predominant types of nonmelanoma skin cancer, represent the vast majority of skin cancer cases. There were an estimated 3.3 million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer in 2012 and an estimated 91,270 new cases of melanoma skin cancer in 2018.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Recognition of Risk Status</h3>\r\n<p>Exposure to UV radiation during childhood and adolescence increases the risk of skin cancer later in life, especially when more severe damage occurs, such as with severe sunburns. Persons with fair skin types (ivory or pale skin, light hair and eye color, freckles, or those who sunburn easily) are at increased risk of skin cancer. Persons who use tanning beds and those with a history of sunburns or previous skin cancer are also at substantially increased risk of skin cancer. Other factors that further increase risk include an increased number of nevi (moles) and atypical nevi, family history of skin cancer, HIV infection, and history of receiving an organ transplant. Most studies of interventions to increase sun protection behaviors have been limited to persons with fair skin types.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2\"><span>2-4</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Behavioral counseling interventions target sun protection behaviors to reduce UV radiation exposure. UV radiation is a known carcinogen<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation5\"><span>5</span></a></sup> that damages DNA and causes most skin cancer cases.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> A substantial body of observational evidence demonstrates that the strongest connection between UV radiation exposure and skin cancer results from exposure in childhood and adolescence. Sun protection behaviors include the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun-protection factor of 15 or greater; wearing hats, sunglasses, or sun-protective clothing; avoiding sun exposure; seeking shade during midday hours (10 am to 4 pm); and avoiding indoor tanning bed use.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions available in or referable from a primary care setting result in a moderate increase in the use of sun protection behaviors for persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions available in or referable from a primary care setting result in a small increase in the use of sun protection behaviors for persons older than 24 years with fair skin types.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found insufficient evidence regarding the benefits of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms related to behavioral counseling interventions and sun protection behaviors in young persons or adults are small. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence regarding the harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions have a moderate net benefit for young adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions have a small benefit in adults older than 24 years with fair skin types.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3><strong><a id=\"clinical\" name=\"clinical\"></a></strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic persons without a history of skin cancer. Because most trials of skin cancer counseling predominantly include persons with fair skin types, the USPSTF limited its recommendation to this population.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Persons with fair skin types (ivory or pale skin, light eye color, red or blond hair, freckles, those who sunburn easily) are at increased risk of skin cancer and should be counseled. Other factors that further increase risk include a history of sunburns, previous use of indoor tanning beds, and a family or personal history of skin cancer. Persons with an increased number of nevi and atypical nevi are at increased risk of melanoma. Persons with a compromised immune system (eg, persons living with HIV, persons who have received an organ transplant) are at increased risk of skin cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>All studies conducted in children and adolescents focused on sun protection behaviors; most were directed at parents, and some provided child-specific materials or messages. Half of the interventions included face-to-face counseling, and all included print materials. Three studies provided the intervention in conjunction with well-child visits. The majority of studies conducted in young adults and adults focused on improving sun protection behaviors, and 2 studies used &ldquo;appearance-focused&rdquo; messages. The mode of delivery varied and included mail-based, face-to-face or telephone counseling, and technology-based (text messages, online programs and modules, personal UV facial photographs) interventions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Counseling adults about performing skin self-examination appears to result in an increase of such examinations. The potential benefit of behavioral counseling about skin self-examination is uncertain because of the lack of evidence on the link between behavior change and skin cancer or other health outcomes. In addition, there is no evidence about the incremental benefit that might occur with skin self-examination above the benefit from counseling for skin protective behaviors and from current levels of skin examinations being performed by clinicians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Skin self-examination is performed by the patient and is noninvasive. Psychosocial harms, such as anxiety or cancer worry, are possible. If skin self-examination leads to biopsy, procedural harms such as pain, bleeding, scarring, or infection could occur.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation7\"><span>7</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>The frequency of behavioral counseling for skin self-examination in the asymptomatic population is not well known.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends child care center&ndash;based, primary and middle school&ndash;based, and multicomponent community-wide interventions for the prevention of skin cancer.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup> These interventions combine school- and community-based communications and policy to increase preventive behaviors (eg, covering up, using shade, or avoiding the sun during peak UV hours) among certain populations in specific settings.</p>\r\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides information to help guide patients and clinicians regarding sun protection and the use and effectiveness of broad-spectrum sunscreen.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation9\"><span>9</span></a></sup> The FDA has determined that broad-spectrum sunscreens with a sun-protection factor of 15 or greater, reapplied at least every 2 hours, protect against both UVA and UVB radiation and reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. The FDA also provides consumer education materials on the dangers of indoor tanning.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation10\"><span>10</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The Environmental Protection Agency provides a variety of educational tools regarding sun safety, including state-specific information, and interactive widgets and smartphone applications that forecast UV exposure by zip code or city. It also provides sun safety fact sheets and handouts, including age-appropriate materials.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation11\"><span>11</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued a recommendation on screening for skin cancer in adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation12\"><span>12</span></a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Interventions included tailored mailings, print materials, and in-person counseling by health professionals. Interventions for children were directed mostly toward parents; some materials were child-specific. Counseling interventions for children, their parents, or both provided messages focused on increasing sun protection behaviors (eg, using sunscreen, avoiding midday sun, wearing sun-protective clothing). Some print-based interventions included materials tailored to the child&rsquo;s risk level, barriers to change, self-efficacy, or other factors. Health professionals providing in-person counseling included primary care clinicians and health educators.</p>\r\n<p>One trial of an intervention involving children 3 years and younger used clinician counseling and print materials for parents promoting child sun protection with sun protection aids (sunscreen samples and hat).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation13\"><span>13</span></a></sup> Several trials in children aged 3 to 10 years used standard or tailored mailings over 1 to 36 months.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation14\"><span>14-17</span></a></sup> One study also included a DVD in addition to a standard mailing promoting sun protection. One trial used a 1-day, in-person parent education session with a children's video, print materials, and sun protection aids (shirt, hat, and sunscreen). For the single study in adolescents, clinicians directly counseled participants, with 4 follow-up telephone counseling sessions by a health educator over 18 months; mailed materials and sunscreen samples were also used.</p>\r\n<p>In the 16 trials among adults, interventions included a variety of messages and components, conducted in a range of settings.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation4\">4</a></sup></span> Technology-based interventions included an interactive web program and tailored text messages on sun protection, as well as appearance-focused print materials. The web program study reported reduced sunburns after the intervention, which provided information on topics such as indoor tanning, UV radiation exposure and health, skin cancer, sunscreen, and skin examination. Each module took about 10 minutes to complete and included a goal-setting section. Other interventions that increased sun protection behaviors in adults included mailed print materials containing personalized risk feedback and recommendations, self-monitoring aids for UV exposure, and skin cancer prevention and detection information; individualized computer reports; and an interactive educational computer program on skin cancer prevention that provided individual feedback on personal risk of skin cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>A better understanding of the effectiveness of counseling on the use of sun protection behaviors in adults 25 years and older is needed to address the key evidence gap on counseling for this age group. Research that evaluates the association between UV exposure during adulthood and skin cancer risk would also be valuable.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, studies regarding the effectiveness of counseling persons without a fair skin type are lacking. Ideally, research studies would provide measurements of sun exposure, sunburn, precursor skin lesions, and cancer among large trial populations, with an emphasis on behaviors and health outcomes among persons who receive an intervention focused on sun protection behaviors. Such studies would also assess whether these behaviors continue after trial completion. These cohorts should include populations with diverse skin colors and should include adolescents, young adults, and preschool-aged children and their parents. These studies may be used to further develop technologies and vehicles for administering relevant interventions for behavior change in the primary care setting, especially among nonwhite persons, young adults, and persons who practice indoor or outdoor tanning. Further evidence is needed to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer and premature death.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The US Surgeon General,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation40\"><span>40</span></a></sup> American Cancer Society,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation41\"><span>41</span></a></sup> American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation42\"><span>42</span></a></sup> American Academy of Pediatrics,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation43\"><span>43</span></a></sup> Royal Australian College of General Practitioners,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation44\"><span>44</span></a></sup> and the World Health Organization&rsquo;s International Agency for Research on Cancer<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation45\"><span>45</span></a></sup> endorse the involvement of clinicians in counseling patients about skin cancer prevention.</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends education and policy approaches to encourage sun protection behaviors in child care centers, schools, recreational sites, and occupational settings.

Recent studies in children younger than 10 years resulted in the USPSTF extending the lower end of the age range to 6 months, the minimum age recommended for sunscreen use. Based on additional evidence since the prior recommendation, the USPSTF now also recommends that clinicians consider selectively offering counseling to adults older than 24 years with fair skin types. As in 2012, the evidence on persons without a fair skin type remains insufficient for this population to be included in the recommendation statement. The evidence continues to be insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer, as it was in 2009.</p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. Melanoma is less common than basal or squamous cell carcinoma but has a much higher death rate. In 2018, an estimated 91,270 new cases of melanoma are expected, representing 5.2% of all new cancer cases.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> An estimated 9730 persons will die of the disease, representing 1.6% of all cancer deaths.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation18\"><span>18</span></a></sup> Although age-adjusted incidence rates have increased from 1989 to 2014 (from 13.7 to 25.2 cases per 100,000 persons), the death rate has remained fairly stable over the same period (from 2.7 to 2.6 deaths per 100,000 persons).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation18\"><span>18</span></a></sup> Adults older than 50 years; men; and persons with fair skin types are at increased risk. Melanoma is most frequently diagnosed among adults aged 65 to 74 years; death rates are highest among the middle-aged and elderly. Melanoma is 5 times more common among Hispanic adults and 25 times more common among white than African American adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation18\"><span>18</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Nonmelanoma skin cancer, of which most cases are basal and squamous cell skin cancer, is associated with a substantial burden to the patient but rarely results in death. Basal cell skin cancer constitutes about 80% of nonmelanoma skin cancer cases, and squamous cell skin cancer constitutes about 20%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> In general, nonmelanoma skin cancer accounts for a small percentage of all cancer deaths, mostly in older adults or persons with a compromised immune system.

The review also sought evidence on the link between counseling and behavior change, the link between behavior change and skin cancer incidence, and the harms of counseling or changes in sun protection behavior. In addition, the review examined evidence regarding counseling patients to perform skin self-examination and skin cancer outcomes and the harms of skin self-examination.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Behavioral Counseling Interventions to Change Behavior</h3>\r\n<p>Many counseling interventions were found to be moderately effective in modifying sun protection behaviors among children, adolescents, and young adults but less effective in adults. Both traditional cancer prevention and appearance-focused messages (ie, stressing the aging effects of UV radiation on the skin) increased sun protection behaviors compared with control groups.</p>\r\n<p>Of the 6 trials that evaluated the effect of interventions on sun protection behaviors among children and adolescents, 5 reported a statistically significant improvement in parent-reported composite scores of child sun protection behaviors compared with control groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation13\"><span>13</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation15\">15</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation17\">17</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation21\">21</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation22\">22</a></sup></span> Four of the 6 trials specifically targeted children aged 3 to 10 years, 1 trial focused on children from birth to 3 years, and 1 trial focused on adolescents aged 11 to 15 years. Among the 4 trials in children aged 3 to 10 years, 3 showed statistically significant differences in changes in sun protection behavior and sunscreen use at 3 months to 3 years of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation14\"><span>14-16</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>A cluster randomized clinical trial<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation13\"><span>13</span></a></sup> that provided counseling to parents of newborns in a series of 4 well-child visits showed statistically significant improvement in composite sun protection scores in the intervention group. However, most individual measures were not statistically significant, and it was difficult to determine the clinical relevance of the small improvements. An in-person counseling intervention targeting adolescents and involving clinicians and health educators showed that sun protection scores were higher in the intervention group than in the control group at 2 years of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation21\"><span>21</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Adequate evidence of the effectiveness of counseling interventions was found in 2 of the 3 fair-quality trials conducted among young adults. In a web-based study of 18- to 25-year olds, participants viewed an interactive 12-module web program featuring 10-minute topics such as indoor tanning, UV exposure and health, skin cancer, and skin examination.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation22\"><span>22</span></a></sup> At 3 months of follow-up, there was a significant improvement in past-month UV exposure and sun protection behaviors, sunscreen use, outdoor tanning, and skin self-examination. Another study (a randomized clinical trial) used a video intervention, with or without UV facial photography; the intervention showed no effect on composite sun protection scores.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation23\"><span>23</span></a></sup> In the third young adult study, women who used indoor tanning were given a 24-page booklet that detailed the effects of UV radiation and indoor tanning and appearance-enhancing alternatives to indoor tanning. At 6 months of follow-up, there was a significantly smaller increase in indoor tanning sessions in the past 3 months in the intervention group than in the control group.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation24\"><span>24</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence of the effectiveness of counseling interventions in adults older than 24 years is mixed. Six of 12 trials that addressed sun protection behavior composite scores in adults found an increase in such behaviors compared with control groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation4\">4</a></sup></span> Three of these interventions promoted sun protection with tailored mailings, 2 used interactive online programs, and 1 used tailored text messages. Four of 7 trials assessing sunscreen use found an increase in this outcome. Of 3 trials of self-reported indoor tanning behavior, only 1 trial using an appearance-focused intervention among young female adults noted a significant improvement compared with the control group.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation24\"><span>24</span></a></sup> Effective interventions were more often of longer duration or had more frequent contacts with participants during the study period.</p>\r\n<p>Trials of counseling interventions that focused on counseling patients to perform skin self-examination as a means of reducing skin cancer risk were inconclusive. A trial with more than 1300 participants showed that those who received a skin self-examination counseling intervention did not have significant differences in the incidence of skin cancer cases or atypical nevi compared with those in the control group at 12 months of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation25\"><span>25</span></a></sup> Several studies showed that skin self-examination interventions increase the likelihood of participants reporting that they perform skin self-examination.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation4\">4</a></sup></span> Additional studies are needed to determine the direct effect of skin self-examination on skin cancer risk.</p>\r\n<h3>Link Between Behavior Change and Cancer Risk</h3>\r\n<h4>Sun Exposure</h4>\r\n<p>Total and recreational sun exposure during childhood is associated with increased melanoma risk. Studies that measured long-term or total sun exposure showed mixed association between increased sun exposure and skin cancer risk. Several fair- to good-quality studies demonstrated a link between adult recreational exposure to UV radiation and increased melanoma risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> One large population-based study showed increased risk of both melanoma incidence and melanoma death with higher quartiles of UV exposure.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation26\"><span>26</span></a></sup> Two recent meta-analyses and 2 cohort studies also showed an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in persons with increased exposure to ambient UV radiation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Indoor Tanning</h4>\r\n<p>Indoor tanning is associated with increased melanoma risk, and younger age at first indoor tanning exposure increases this risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation27\"><span>27</span></a></sup> A meta-analysis provided evidence of a dose-response relationship between melanoma risk and indoor tanning in women younger than 50 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation28\"><span>28</span></a></sup> Four studies found that increasing indoor tanning frequency was associated with increased melanoma risk. Two systematic reviews, 1 cohort study, and 1 case-control study found evidence that having ever used indoor tanning was associated with increased risk of squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma compared with never having used indoor tanning.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation29\"><span>29-32</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Sunscreen Use</h4>\r\n<p>Two studies in adults provided new evidence of a protective effect of sunscreen use. One study, which was considered by the USPSTF for its previous recommendation statement, analyzed long-term follow-up data from a randomized clinical trial. In this study, intervention group participants applied sunscreen daily, while control group participants continued their usual behavior. At 4.5 years, the intervention group had a decreased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation33\"><span>33</span></a></sup> Ten years after conclusion of the trial, the intervention group had half as many incident melanomas as the control group. Overall, melanoma risk was reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group and was most pronounced for invasive melanoma compared with in situ melanoma.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation34\"><span>34</span></a></sup> A large US case-control study also demonstrated a lower likelihood of melanoma in persons routinely using sunscreen compared with those who do not.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation29\"><span>29</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Skin Self-Examination and Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence on the effectiveness of skin self-examination in reducing death or illness is lacking. One 20-year follow-up study showed no association between skin self-examination and skin cancer death.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation35\"><span>35</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Potential harms of interventions promoting sun protection behaviors include skin reactions to sunscreen lotion, vitamin D deficiency, reduced physical activity due to avoiding the outdoors, and a paradoxical increase in sun exposure from a false reassurance of protection from sunscreen use. Sunscreen use can be associated with numerous transient skin reactions, including allergic, irritant, and photoallergic contact dermatitis. Although vitamin D deficiency is a hypothetical harm of sun avoidance, recent studies have not shown an association between sunscreen use and decreased vitamin D levels. Among the sparse evidence available, 1 study suggested that sun protection behaviors do not lead to decreased physical activity or increased body mass index.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation36\"><span>36</span></a></sup> Older studies reported that sunscreen use did not result in an intentional increase in sun exposure, but 2 recent studies showed that sunscreen use was associated with higher likelihood of multiple sunburns.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation37\"><span>37</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation38\">38</a></sup></span></p>\r\n<p>Persons who performed skin self-examination were more likely to subsequently undergo a skin procedure compared with those who did not, as evidenced by 1 trial, indicating a potential harm of skin self-examination. Although melanoma death rates have remained stable, the increasing number of skin biopsies and rising melanoma incidence over recent decades provide evidence for overdiagnosis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation39\"><span>39</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF determined that behavioral counseling interventions are of moderate benefit in increasing sun protection behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults with fair skin types. The link of behavior change to outcomes is supported by several trials and a substantial body of observational evidence showing that the strongest connection between UV radiation exposure and skin cancer stems from exposure in childhood and adolescence. Evidence of a connection between sun exposure in adulthood and melanoma is less robust than in childhood. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms related to counseling or sun protection behaviors are small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of counseling to decrease UV exposure and reduce skin cancer risk is moderate in children, adolescents, and young adults aged 6 months to 24 years.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions result in a small increase in sun protection behaviors in adults older than 24 years. The harms of counseling are small. The USPSTF determined that the evidence supporting a link between decreased UV exposure in adulthood and skin cancer risk is adequate. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of counseling to decrease UV exposure and reduce skin cancer risk is small in adults older than 24 years.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>UV radiation from both solar and artificial sources has been classified as a human carcinogen by national and international organizations. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the effect of UV radiation exposure from typical doses of sunlight varies over the life span, with some evidence of a window of biological vulnerability in childhood and adolescence that translates into increased skin cancer risk later in life. Much of the available evidence concerns the most common skin lesions, nonmalignant neoplasia and basal cell and squamous cell cancer. It remains unclear whether the same mechanisms apply to melanoma risk. For all 3 types of cancer, increasing intermittent or recreational sun exposure and total sun exposure are linked to increased risk. Artificial UV radiation, specifically indoor tanning, is also associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Indoor tanning before age 35 years, for more than 10 tanning sessions over a lifetime, and for longer than 1 year have been linked to increased cancer risk.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 10 to November 6, 2017. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified the definition of fair skin type for the purposes of this recommendation. Comments requested more details about the behavioral counseling interventions, and the USPSTF provided additional information on implementation strategies. Several comments requested clarification about why skin self-examination is included in this recommendation; the USPSTF clarified that this recommendation addresses several preventive counseling interventions, including evidence about primary care clinicians counseling patients to perform skin self-examination. The USPSTF also added suggestions for practice regarding the I statement, information on newer technologies, and further information on the evidence for the different age ranges in the recommendations.</p>",

However, no instrument has been clearly identified as accurate and feasible for identifying older adults at increased risk for falls. Although many studies used a variety of risk factors functional tests, or both involving gait, balance, or mobility to identify study participants, history of falls was the most commonly used factor that consistently identified persons at high risk for falls.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that exercise interventions have a moderate benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that multifactorial interventions have a small benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in preventing falls in older adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Based on the noninvasive nature of most of the interventions, the low likelihood of serious harms, and the available information from studies reporting few serious harms, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of exercise and multifactorial interventions as no greater than small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of vitamin D supplementation are small to moderate; evidence suggests that the harms of vitamin D supplementation at very high dosages may be moderate.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that exercise interventions provide a moderate net benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that multifactorial interventions provide a small net benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that vitamin D supplementation has no net benefit in preventing falls in older adults.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3><a id=\"consider\" name=\"consider\"></a>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.</p>\r\n<h3>Brief Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>When determining to whom these recommendations apply, primary care clinicians can reasonably consider a small number of risk factors to identify older adults who are at increased risk for falls. Age is strongly related to risk for falls. Studies most commonly used a history of falls to identify increased risk for future falls; history of falls is generally considered together or sequentially with other key risk factors, particularly impairments in mobility, gait, and balance. A pragmatic approach to identifying persons at high risk for falls, consistent with the enrollment criteria for intervention trials, would be to assess for a history of falls or for problems in physical functioning and limited mobility. Clinicians could also use assessments of gait and mobility, such as the Timed Up and Go test.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation5\"><span>5-7</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Interventions</h3>\r\n<h4>Exercise Interventions</h4>\r\n<p>Effective exercise interventions include supervised individual and group classes and physical therapy, although most studies reviewed by the USPSTF included group exercise. Given the heterogeneity of interventions reviewed by the USPSTF, it is difficult to identify specific components of exercise that are particularly efficacious. The most common exercise component was gait, balance, and functional training (17 trials), followed by resistance training (13 trials), flexibility (8 trials), and endurance training (5 trials). Three studies included tai chi, and 5 studies included general physical activity. The most common frequency and duration for exercise interventions was 3 sessions per week for 12 months, although duration of exercise interventions ranged from 2 to 42 months.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup> The 2008 US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines recommended that older adults get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, as well as muscle-strengthening activities twice per week.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation9\"><span>9</span></a></sup> It also recommended performing balance training on 3 or more days per week for older adults at risk for falls because of a recent fall or difficulty walking.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation9\"><span>9</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Multifactorial Interventions</h4>\r\n<p>Multifactorial interventions include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for falls and subsequent customized interventions for each patient based on issues identified in the initial assessment. The initial assessment could include a multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment or an assessment using a combination of various components, such as balance, gait, vision, postural blood pressure, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health. In studies, nursing staff usually performed the assessment, and a number of different professionals performed subsequent interventions, including nurses, clinicians, physical therapists, exercise instructors, occupational therapists, dieticians, or nutritionists. Intervention components vary based on the initial assessment and could include group or individual exercise, psychological interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy), nutrition therapy, education, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, and referral to specialists (eg, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or cardiologist). For additional details on multifactorial interventions reviewed by the USPSTF, please see the full evidence report.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation8\"><span>8</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation10\">10</a></sup></span></p>\r\n<h4>Other Interventions</h4>\r\n<p>The following single interventions lack sufficient evidence for or against their use to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults when offered alone and not in the context of a multifactorial intervention: environmental modification, medication management, psychological interventions, and combination interventions not customized to an individual risk profile.</p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Fractures are an important injury associated with falls, and the USPSTF has issued 2 related recommendation statements on the prevention of fractures. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation11\"><span>11</span></a></sup> In its recommendation on vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures, the USPSTF states that it found insufficient evidence on vitamin D or calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in men, premenopausal women at any dose, and in postmenopausal women at doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium; the USPSTF recommends against supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D or 1000 mg or less of calcium in postmenopausal women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation12\"><span>12</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidance on implementing community-based interventions to prevent falls.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation13\"><span>13</span></a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Although the evidence does not support routinely performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management in all older adults, there may be reasons for providing this service to certain patients. Important items in the patient's medical history could include the circumstances of prior falls and the presence of comorbid medical conditions. The American Geriatric Society (AGS) recommends multifactorial risk assessment with multicomponent interventions in older adults who have had 2 falls in the past year (1 fall if combined with gait or balance problems), have gait or balance problems, or present with an acute fall.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14\"><span>14</span></a></sup> According to the AGS, evaluation of balance and mobility, vision, and orthostatic or postural hypotension are effective components of multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management, as well as review of medication use and home environment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14\"><span>14</span></a></sup> Follow-up and comprehensive management of identified risk factors are essential to the effectiveness of this strategy.</p>\r\n<p>The burden of falls on patients and the health care system is large. Reducing the incidence of falls would also improve the socialization and functioning of older adults who have previously fallen and fear falling again. Many other interventions could potentially be useful to prevent falls, but because of the heterogeneity in the target patient population, heterogeneity (ie, multiplicity) of predisposing factors, and their additive or synergistic nature, the effectiveness of other interventions is not known. However, many interventions with insufficient evidence to support their use to prevent falls have other arguments that support their use.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Studies are needed on the clinical validation of primary care tools to identify older adults at increased risk for falls. More efficacy trials are needed on how the following interventions may help prevent falls if offered alone and not as part of multifactorial interventions: environmental modification, medication management, and psychological interventions. Additional research is needed on the effectiveness of interventions in different age groups, in particular adults older than 85 years. Additional research to identify effective components of exercise interventions would also be useful.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>The National Institute on Aging outlines similar interventions for the prevention of falls: exercise for strength and balance, monitoring for environmental hazards, regular medical care to ensure optimized hearing and vision, and medication management.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation30\"><span>30</span></a></sup> According to the AGS, detecting a history of falls is fundamental to a falls reduction program, and it recommends asking all older adults once a year about falls.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14\"><span>14</span></a></sup> The AGS further recommends that older persons who have experienced a fall should have their gait and balance assessed using one of the available evaluations; those who cannot perform or perform poorly on a standardized gait and balance test should be given a multifactorial falls risk assessment that includes a focused medical history, physical examination, functional assessment, and an environmental assessment. The AGS also recommends the following interventions for falls prevention: adaptation or modification of home environment; withdrawal or minimization of psychoactive or other medications; management of postural hypotension; management of foot problems and footwear; exercise (particularly balance), strength, and gait training; and vitamin D supplementation of at least 800 IU per day for persons with vitamin D deficiency or who are at increased risk for falls. The AGS found insufficient evidence to recommend vision screening alone as a single intervention for falls prevention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends STEADI, a coordinated approach to implementing the AGS clinical practice guidelines for falls prevention that consists of 3 core elements: screen to identify fall risk, assess modifiable risk factors, and intervene using effective clinical and community strategies to reduce the identified risk. Clinical strategies include but are not limited to physical therapy and medication management. Community strategies include but are not limited to evidence-based exercise programs and home modification.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation31\"><span>31</span></a></sup> Similar to the 2012 USPSTF recommendation, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. It does not recommend automatically performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation32\"><span>32</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><sup><span>Update of Previous</span></sup></strong><sup><span> Recommendation</span></sup></p>\r\n<p><span>The USPSTF last issued a recommendation on interventions to prevent falls in older adults in 2012. At that time, consistent with the current recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommended exercise (B recommendation) and selectively offering multifactorial interventions (C recommendation) to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk for falls. At that time, the USPSTF also recommended vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls (B recommendation), based on previous evidence that found a reduction in the number of persons experiencing a fall. The current review excluded studies considered in the previous review that enrolled persons with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency because, on further consideration, vitamin D supplementation in these examined additional fall-related outcomes, including incident falls (in addition to the number of persons experiencing a fall, which was considered in the previous review). With this revised scope of review, as well as newer evidence from trials reporting no benefit, the USPSTF found that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in falls prevention in community-dwelling older adults not known to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Thus, the USPSTF now recommends against vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults.</span></p>",

Although many studies reported on mortality, they were generally underpowered to detect changes in mortality, and results were not statistically significant. The most commonly reported outcomes were falls and number of persons experiencing a fall; half (31/62) of the trials were powered to detect clinically meaningful differences in these 2 outcomes.

The initial assessment to screen for modifiable falls risk factors used either a multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment or a specific falls risk assessment that evaluated any of the following: balance, gait, vision, cardiovascular health, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health. Treatment interventions varied substantially across studies and included targeted combinations of any of the following components: exercise, psychological interventions, nutrition therapy, knowledge, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, and referrals to physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, or specialists (eg, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or cardiologist). Most studies referred participants to or offered an exercise or physical therapy intervention.

Exercise and physical therapy may improve strength and balance and therefore may result in fewer falls. Many interrelated variables affect the health status of older adults, some of which probably have additive effects and may explain why multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management is effective in preventing falls. Vitamin D receptors have been identified in various cell types, including skeletal muscle, and stimulation of these receptors promotes protein synthesis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation26\"><span>26</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation27\"><span>27</span></a></sup> Although it has been previously demonstrated that vitamin D or its metabolites may have a beneficial effect on muscle strength and balance,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation28\"><span>28</span></a></sup> the current evidence shows no benefit in preventing falls. In addition, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) concluded that there may be a potential U-shaped relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels and health outcomes, with serum levels greater than 125 nmol/L being associated with worse health outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation29\"><span>29</span></a></sup></span></p>\r\n<p><span> <br></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Response to Public Comment</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span> <br></span></p>\r\n<p><span>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 26, 2017, to October 24, 2017. In response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified that physical therapy, which was described separately from exercise interventions in the 2012 recommendation, is now included among &ldquo;exercise interventions&rdquo; in the current recommendation. Additionally, the USPSTF clarified that these recommendations apply to older adults not known to be vitamin D deficient. The USPSTF added findings on additional outcomes, such as quality of life, as well. A few comments requested additional details about effective exercise and multifactorial interventions. Given the heterogeneity of included interventions, it is difficult for the USPSTF to identify specific components that it found to be particularly effective; however, the USPSTF included results from some exploratory analyses. A few comments also requested a recommendation on other interventions, such as reducing medication prescriptions and comprehensive eye examination. The USPSTF can only recommend the use of an intervention when it finds adequate evidence that the benefits outweigh the harms. Although the USPSTF may have reviewed additional interventions, it did not find adequate evidence to issue a recommendation on all of the reviewed interventions. Interventions that target health conditions that may affect falls risk but have other reasons for assessment and treatment (such as visual impairment or neurologic disorders) were considered to be out of scope for the current review.

      "other": "<h3>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h3>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Research is needed to determine whether daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium reduces fracture incidence in postmenopausal women and in older men. Prospective studies should assess the potential benefits of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in premenopausal women on fracture incidence later in life. Studies need to be adequately powered and should evaluate consistent fracture outcomes. Studies are also needed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on diverse populations. Because white women have the highest risk for osteoporotic fractures, most fracture prevention studies have been conducted in this population, and it is difficult to extrapolate results to nonwhite populations.

The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net benefit of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. Because of the lack of effect on fracture incidence and the increased incidence of kidney stones in intervention groups, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no net benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. Although women enrolled in the WHI trial were predominately white, the lower risk for fractures in nonwhite women makes it very unlikely that a benefit would exist in this population. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on calcium supplementation alone, as well as on supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net benefit of supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Calcium contributes to bone growth, and vitamin D helps bones absorb calcium. Normal, healthy bones turn over calcium constantly, replacing calcium loss with new calcium. The human body has 2 main sources of vitamin D. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>), the larger source of vitamin D, is synthesized in the skin by UVB rays from the sun. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is converted to its active form through enzymatic processes in the liver and kidney. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D<sub>2</sub>) is consumed in the diet and can be found naturally in a few foods, such as mushrooms and egg yolks, but is more commonly consumed as a supplement or in fortified foods and beverages, such as milk, yogurt, and orange juice.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation35\"><span>35</span></a></sup> Most cells contain specific receptors for the active form of vitamin D. Stimulation of skeletal muscle receptors promotes protein synthesis, and vitamin D has a beneficial effect on muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D controls calcium absorption in the small intestines, interacts with parathyroid hormone to help maintain calcium homeostasis between the blood and bones, and is essential for bone growth and maintaining bone density. Obtaining insufficient amounts of vitamin D through diet or sun exposure can lead to inadequate levels of the hormone calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D), which in turn can lead to impaired absorption of dietary calcium. Consequently, the body uses calcium from skeletal stores, which can weaken existing bones.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>The current recommendation against supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures is primarily based on the finding of no benefit with supplementation at lower doses. More evidence is needed to determine whether higher doses of supplementation may be more effective at preventing fractures. Although the risk for kidney stones could theoretically increase at higher doses of supplementation, the overall determination of net benefit or net harm will depend on whether a benefit in fracture prevention is also found at higher doses and, if so, what the magnitude of that benefit is.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Response to Public Comment</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 26, 2017, to October 24, 2017. To clarify which population the recommendation applies to, the USPSTF revised the title to &ldquo;Vitamin D, Calcium, or Combined Supplementation for the Primary Prevention of Fractures in Community-Dwelling Adults.&rdquo; Some comments expressed concern that the recommendation against supplementation with vitamin D would be misinterpreted by persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. Persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency were excluded from the evidence review, and thus are excluded from the recommendation statement, as described in the &ldquo;Summary of Recommendations and Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Patient Population Under Consideration&rdquo; sections. Other comments requested clarification of the role of vitamin D in persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. This is beyond the scope of the recommendation and has been clarified in the &ldquo;Scope of Review&rdquo; section. Some comments also expressed confusion over why a finding of &ldquo;insufficient evidence&rdquo; was issued for supplementation at higher doses if the USPSTF recommends against supplementation at lower doses. The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses provides no benefit. Evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting, with some studies showing a reduction in certain fracture types at higher doses, and others showing no reduction or even an increase. More studies are needed to more clearly determine if supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or both consistently prevents fractures. If future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer that affects men. In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 13%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. In autopsy studies of men who died of other causes, more than 20% of men aged 50 to 59 years and more than 33% of men aged 70 to 79 years were found to have prostate cancer.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup> In some men, the cancer is more aggressive and leads to death. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years, and more than two-thirds of all men who die of prostate cancer are older than 75 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> African American men have an increased lifetime risk of prostate cancer death compared with those of other races/ethnicities (4.2% for African American men, 2.9% for Hispanic men, 2.3% for white men, and 2.1% for Asian and Pacific Islander men).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for prostate cancer begins with a test that measures the amount of PSA protein in the blood. An elevated PSA level may be caused by prostate cancer but can also be caused by other conditions, including an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). Some men without prostate cancer may therefore have positive screening results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). Men with a positive PSA test result may undergo a transrectal ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the prostate to diagnose prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The goal of screening for prostate cancer is to identify high-risk, localized prostate cancer that can be successfully treated, thereby preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup><span><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></span> Screening programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> Current results from screening trials show no reductions in all-cause mortality from screening. There is inadequate evidence to assess whether the benefits for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer aged 55 to 69 years are different than the benefits for the average-risk population. There is also inadequate evidence to assess whether there are benefits to starting screening in these high-risk groups before age 55 years.</p>\r\n<p>Adequate evidence from RCTs is consistent with no benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on prostate cancer mortality in men 70 years and older.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The harms of screening for prostate cancer include harms from the PSA screening test and subsequent harms from diagnosis and treatment. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. One major trial in men screened every 2 to 4 years concluded that, over 10 years, more than 15% of men experienced at least 1 false-positive test result.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation5\"><span>5</span></a></sup> Harms of diagnostic procedures include complications of prostate biopsy, such as pain, hematospermia (blood in semen or ejaculate), and infection. Approximately 1% of prostate biopsies result in complications requiring hospitalization. The false-positive and complication rates from biopsy are higher in older men.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of screening and diagnostic procedures are at least small.</p>\r\n<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer leads to the diagnosis of prostate cancer in some men whose cancer would never have become symptomatic during their lifetime. Treatment of these men results in harms and provides them with no benefit. This is known as overdiagnosis, and follow-up of large randomized trials suggests that 20% to 50% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer through screening may be overdiagnosed.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> Overdiagnosis rates would be expected to increase with age and to be highest in men 70 years and older because older men have high risk of death from competing causes.</p>\r\n<p>Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bothersome bowel symptoms. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence requiring use of pads, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of men who receive radiation therapy experience long-term sexual erectile dysfunction and up to 1 in 6 men experience long-term bothersome bowel symptoms, including bowel urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup> Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of overdiagnosis and treatment are at least moderate.</p>\r\n<p>Adequate evidence shows that the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men because of increased risk of false-positive results, harms from diagnostic biopsy, and harms from treatment.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has both potential benefits and harms. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer unless men express a preference for screening after being informed of and understanding the benefits and risks. The decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer requires that each man incorporate his own values about the potential benefits and harms. The potential harms of screening, diagnostic procedures, and treatment occur soon after screening takes place. Although the potential benefits may occur any time after screening, they generally occur years after treatment, because progression from asymptomatic, screen-detected cancer to symptomatic, metastasized cancer or death (if it occurs at all) may take years or decades to occur.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men. How each man weighs specific benefits and harms will determine whether the overall net benefit is small.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older do not outweigh the expected harms.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to adult men in the general US population without symptoms or a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer. It also applies to men at increased risk of death from prostate cancer because of race/ethnicity or family history of prostate cancer. The sections below provide more information on how this recommendation applies to African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Older age, African American race, and family history of prostate cancer are the most important risk factors for the development of prostate cancer. Other factors with weaker associations and less evidence include diets high in fat and low in vegetable consumption. Cigarette smoking is associated with higher risk of prostate cancer mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening</h3>\r\n<p>PSA-based screening is the usual method of screening and has been studied in several large trials. Although new screening methods are being developed (such as single- and adjusted-threshold testing and PSA velocity and doubling time), evidence is insufficient to support one method of PSA-based screening over another. Evidence is also insufficient that using a prebiopsy risk calculator, with or without measurement of free PSA levels, or using genetic or adjunctive imaging tests meaningfully changes the potential benefits and harms of screening. This is an important area of current research that has the potential to decrease the harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. The use of digital rectal examination as a screening modality is not recommended because there is a lack of evidence on the benefits; digital rectal examination was either eliminated from or not included in the major screening trials.</p>\r\n<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has been studied in 3 very large RCTs, each with at least a decade of median follow-up: the US-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), and the Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP). These trials used varying screening intervals (from 1-time screening to every 1 to 4 years) and PSA thresholds (2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL) for diagnostic biopsy.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The PLCO trial may be viewed as a trial of organized vs opportunistic screening for prostate cancer because of the substantial screening rate in the control group and the high screening rate among men in both the control and intervention groups prior to study enrollment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation6\"><span>6</span></a></sup> Men in the intervention group were screened more often than men in the control group, and more men in the intervention group were diagnosed with prostate cancer than in the control group. The trial found no difference between groups in death from prostate cancer after almost 15 years of follow-up (absolute risk, 4.8 per 1000 person-years in the intervention group vs 4.6 per 1000 person-years in the control group; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation7\"><span>7</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In the ERSPC trial, the results suggest that, overall, the number needed to screen is 781 men aged 55 to 69 years at enrollment (95% CI, 490-1929) to prevent 1 man from dying of prostate cancer after 13 years. The results varied across the individual ERSPC sites, and prostate cancer mortality was significantly reduced only at the sites in the Netherlands and Sweden. However, point estimates were in favor of screening at all sites except Switzerland. At the largest site (Finland), there was no significant benefit observed for prostate cancer mortality (rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.75-1.10]), and in Sweden there was an absolute risk reduction of 0.72% (95% CI, 0.50%-0.94%), a 42% relative reduction.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation8\"><span>8-10</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Four ERSPC trial sites reported data on the effect of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on the development of metastatic cancer after 12 years of follow-up. The risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer was 30% lower among men randomized to screening than among men in the control group (absolute risk, 7.05 per 1000 men in the screening group vs 10.14 per 1000 men in the control group [calculated from numbers in the study]). This translates to an absolute reduction in the long-term risk of metastatic prostate cancer of 3.1 cases per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation11\"><span>11</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The CAP trial was a cluster-randomized trial of a single invitation to PSA-based screening in the United Kingdom among 415,357 men. Overall, 34% of invited men received a valid PSA screening test. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the invited group and the control group (absolute risk, 0.30 per 1000 person-years vs 0.31 per 1000 person-years, respectively).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation12\"><span>12</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on clinical stage, tumor grade, and PSA level, prostate cancer is classified as low, medium, or high risk for clinical progression and prostate cancer death. Although treatment is thought to be most immediately beneficial for men with high- and medium-risk prostate cancer, the vast majority of cases of screen-detected cancer are low risk.</p>\r\n<p>As with all screening tests, some men without prostate cancer will receive positive PSA test results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). The false-positive rate for the PSA test depends on the PSA threshold used. Among 5 ERSPC sites that reported the false-positive rate, approximately 1 in 6 men screened at least once had 1 or more false-positive results, and of the positive results in the first round of screening, two-thirds were false positives. In Sweden, where a low PSA threshold (3.0 ng/mL) was used to determine a positive test result and men were screened every 2 years, more than 45% of men who participated in all screening rounds had a false-positive result over 10 years of screening.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation5\"><span>5</span></a></sup> In the PLCO trial, more than two-thirds of men who underwent a prostate biopsy because of a positive PSA test result were found not to have prostate cancer.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation13\"><span>13</span></a></sup> In addition to false-positive results, there are other harms associated with screening and subsequent diagnostic evaluation; biopsies may result in pain, fever, hematospermia, and hospitalization.</p>\r\n<p>The 3 large RCTs on screening predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age in the average-risk population or to obtain a baseline PSA level. Evidence in men 70 years and older does not support routine screening because of the lack of trial evidence of benefit, the low likelihood of benefit given the time to realize benefit, and the increased risk of harms from false-positive results, biopsies, overdiagnosis, and treatment. Although the evidence does not support routine screening in all men older than 70 years, the USPSTF recognizes the common use of PSA-based screening in practice today and understands that some older men will continue to request screening and some clinicians will continue to offer it. Men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit from screening and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered whether there are screening and follow-up approaches that increase the potential for benefit while reducing the potential for harms. Variation across sites in randomized trials of screening suggests there may be greater mortality benefit from screening every other year compared with longer intervals and from using lower PSA thresholds for diagnostic biopsy. Although these approaches may have increased the potential benefit reported in studies, they also resulted in substantially more harms&mdash;more false-positive results, more prostate biopsies, and more cases of overdiagnosis. This trade-off was also observed in a review of decision analysis models; screening protocols using lower PSA thresholds (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation14\"><span>14</span></a> The frequency of screening in the ERSCP sites ranged from every 2 to 7 years. No ERSPC trial site offered screening more often than every 2 years, and many sites screened every 4 years. The PSA threshold for biopsy in the ERSCP sites ranged from 2.5 to 4 ng/mL (except for 10 ng/mL in the earlier years at the Belgium site). In the G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, site, which reported the largest benefit, the frequency of screening was every 2 years, and the threshold for biopsy was 2.5 ng/mL (3.0 ng/mL in the first few years of the study).</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The potential benefit of screening for prostate cancer is because of treatment. Thus, it is important for men to consider both the potential benefits and harms of treatment (including active surveillance) as they consider whether to be screened. Men not able or willing to tolerate treatment should not be screened for prostate cancer. Because most cases of prostate cancer advance very slowly, if at all, the 10-year survival rate for screen-detected, localized prostate cancer is very high. In a recent major trial that enrolled more than 1500 men randomized to receive either active treatment or active surveillance, the 10-year survival rate in all groups was 99%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation15\"><span>15</span></a></sup> The good prognosis for early-stage prostate cancer makes it difficult to study the effectiveness of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Multiple treatment options exist for prostate cancer, and new ones are being developed. In current practice, the 3 most common treatment options for men with screen-detected, localized prostate cancer are surgical removal of the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy, proton beam therapy, or brachytherapy), and active surveillance. The USPSTF considered available evidence on treatment when evaluating the effectiveness of screening and found that current evidence suggests that treatment of early-stage, screen-detected prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy likely reduces risk of clinical progression and metastatic disease and may reduce prostate cancer mortality. More details about the effectiveness and adverse effects of active treatment are provided in the Discussion section.</p>\r\n<p>Active surveillance is a treatment approach that seeks to limit the harms of treatment by allowing men with apparent low-risk prostate cancer to forego surgery or radiation in favor of ongoing monitoring of their cancer. Although protocols vary, active surveillance usually includes regular, repeated PSA testing and often repeated digital rectal examination and prostate biopsy, with potential for exposure to repeated harms from biopsies. Men whose cancer is found to be changing are offered definitive treatment with surgery or radiation therapy. Other treatment monitoring strategies for men with low-risk cancer exist (for example, watchful waiting) and also vary in protocol. Active surveillance has become a more common treatment choice in the United States over the past several years. In a study assessing community-based urology practice in the United States between 2010 and 2013, about half of men with low-risk prostate cancer were treated with radical prostatectomy. The active surveillance rate, however, increased from about 10% in 2005-2009 to 40.4% in 2010-2013 among men with low-risk prostate cancer.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation16\"><span>16</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Active treatment of prostate cancer can result in major adverse effects. About 3 in 1000 men die during or soon after radical prostatectomy, and about 50 in 1000 men have serious surgical complications requiring intervention. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence requiring regular use of pads, and about 2 in 3 men experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of men who receive radiation therapy experience long-term erectile dysfunction, and up to 1 in 6 men experience long-term bothersome bowel symptoms, including bowel urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3\"><span>3</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening for Prostate Cancer in African American Men</h3>\r\n<h4>Burden</h4>\r\n<p>In the United States, African American men are more likely to develop prostate cancer than white men (203.5 vs 121.9 cases per 100,000 men). African American men are also more than twice as likely as white men to die of prostate cancer (44.1 vs 19.1 deaths per 100,000 men).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1\"><span>1</span></a></sup> The higher death rate is attributable in part to an earlier age at cancer onset, more advanced cancer stage at diagnosis, and higher rates of more aggressive cancer (ie, higher tumor grade). These differences in death from prostate cancer may also reflect that African American men have lower rates of receiving high-quality care.</p>\r\n<h4>Available Evidence</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American men.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>\r\n<p>The PLCO trial enrolled 4% African American men, which is not enough to determine whether the overall trial results differed for African American men.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation17\"><span>17</span></a></sup> The ERSPC trial did not record or report any race-specific subgroup information. The low proportion of persons of African descent in European countries during the study period makes it likely that these groups were not well represented.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>An analysis from the PLCO trial found that African American men were significantly more likely to have major infections after prostate biopsy than white men (odds ratio [OR], 7.1 [95% CI, 2.7-18.0]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation13\"><span>13</span></a></sup> Evidence is insufficient to compare the risk of false-positive results, potential for overdiagnosis, and magnitude of harms from prostate cancer treatment in African American vs other men.</p>\r\n<h4>Advising African American Men</h4>\r\n<p>Based on the available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American men. Although it is possible that screening may offer greater benefits for African American men compared with the general population, currently no direct evidence demonstrates whether this is true. Screening, and subsequent diagnosis and treatment, has the potential to increase exposure to potential harms. Decision analysis models suggest that given the higher rates of aggressive prostate cancer in African American men, PSA-based screening may provide greater benefit to African American men than the general population. These models also suggest a potential mortality benefit for African American men when beginning screening before age 55 years. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for clinicians is to inform African American men about their increased risk of developing and dying of prostate cancer as well as the potential benefits and harms of screening so they can make an informed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may differ for African American men, it recognizes the epidemiologic data showing that African American men may develop prostate cancer at younger ages than average-risk men and understands that some African American men and their clinicians will continue to screen at younger ages. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including African American men, older than 70 years.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF strongly encourages research on screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men. It is important to consider both the potential additional benefits and harms to fully understand the value of screening. Studies are needed to confirm that African American men who undergo screening receive similar or greater reductions in prostate cancer mortality compared with men in the general population, as well as to explore the optimal screening frequency and whether beginning screening before age 55 years provides additional benefits in African American men. Studies are also needed to better understand strategies to mitigate harms and maximize benefits of screening, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment (including active surveillance) in African American men. It is also important that research and quality improvement activities continue to work to eliminate disparities in access to high-quality care for men with prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening for Prostate Cancer in Men With a Family History</h3>\r\n<h4>Burden</h4>\r\n<p>The introduction of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has substantially altered the epidemiologic data for prostate cancer, greatly increasing the number of men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and thus also the number of men with a father, brother, or son with a history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<h4>Available Evidence</h4>\r\n<p>It is generally accepted that men with a family history of prostate cancer are more likely to develop prostate cancer. A study of twins in Scandinavia estimated that genetic factors may account for up to 42% of prostate cancer risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation18\"><span>18</span></a></sup> An analysis from the Finnish site of the ERSPC trial concluded that men with at least 1 first-degree relative with prostate cancer were 30% more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than men without a family history.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation19\"><span>19</span></a></sup> Men with 3 first-degree relatives with prostate cancer or 2 close relatives on the same side of the family with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 55 years may have an inheritable form of prostate cancer associated with genetic changes passed down from one generation to the next. This type of prostate cancer is thought to account for less than 10% of all prostate cancer cases.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation20\"><span>20</span></a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>\r\n<p>Of the 7% of men in the PLCO trial who reported a family history of prostate cancer on a baseline questionnaire, prostate cancer mortality was lower among white men in the intervention group than in the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49 [95% CI, 0.22-1.10]; <em>P</em> = 0.08),<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation21\"><span>21</span></a></sup> but the difference was not significant and the confidence interval was wide.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>No studies have assessed the risk of harms related to screening for, diagnosis of, or treatment of prostate cancer based on family history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n<h4>Advising Men With a Family History of Prostate Cancer</h4>\r\n<p>Based on the available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history of prostate cancer. Although it is possible that screening may offer additional potential benefits for these men compared with the general population, screening also has the potential to increase exposure to potential harms, especially among men with relatives whose cancer was overdiagnosed. Men who have a first-degree relative who had advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis, developed metastatic prostate cancer, or died of prostate cancer are probably the most likely to benefit from screening. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for clinicians is to inform men with a family history of prostate cancer, particularly those with multiple first-degree relatives with prostate cancer, about their increased risk of developing cancer as well as the potential earlier age at disease onset. This discussion should include the potential benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer so these men have the opportunity to make an informed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may differ for men with a family history of prostate cancer, it recognizes the epidemiologic data showing that these men are at a greater than average risk and understands that some men and their clinicians will continue to screen at younger ages in men with a family history. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including men with a family history of prostate cancer, older than 70 years.</p>\r\n<p>Epidemiologic studies examining outcomes in men with relatives who died of prostate cancer vs men with relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer who died of other causes may help provide better guidance. Studies are needed that explore the optimal screening frequency and whether beginning screening before age 55 years provides additional benefits for men with a family history of prostate cancer. Additional research is also needed to help identify men with an inheritable form of prostate cancer and to understand how the potential benefits and harms of screening, including screening intervals and starting ages, may differ in these men compared with the general population.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>There are many areas in need of research to improve screening for and treatment of prostate cancer, including</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comparing different screening strategies, including different screening intervals, to fully understand the effects on benefits and harms</li>\r\n<li>Developing, validating, and providing longer-term follow-up of screening and diagnostic techniques, including risk stratification tools, use of baseline PSA level as a risk factor, and use of non&ndash;PSA-based adjunctive tests that can distinguish nonprogressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life, to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment</li>\r\n<li>Screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men, including understanding the potential benefits and harms of different starting ages and screening intervals and the use of active surveillance; given the large disparities in prostate cancer mortality in African American men, this should be a national priority</li>\r\n<li>How to better inform men with a family history of prostate cancer about the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer, including the potential differences in outcomes between men with relatives who died of prostate cancer and men with relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer who died of other causes</li>\r\n<li>How to refine active prostate cancer treatments to minimize harms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>How to better understand patient values about the known benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of prostate cancer; how these values influence men&rsquo;s assessment of the overall benefit vs harm; how to best implement informed decision making programs that incorporate the values and preferences of men and their families about screening; how to adapt the informed decision-making process to a range of diverse patient populations as screening, diagnosis, and treatment strategies evolve; and the effects of informed decision making on health outcomes and patient experience</p>",

The American College of Physicians<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation41\"><span>41</span></a></sup> recommends that clinicians discuss the benefits and harms of screening with men aged 50 to 69 years and only recommends screening for men who prioritize screening and have a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years. The American Urological Association<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation42\"><span>42</span></a></sup> recommends that men aged 55 to 69 years with a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years be informed of the benefits and harms of screening and engage in shared decision making with their clinicians, taking into account each man&rsquo;s values and preferences. It notes that to reduce the harms of screening, the screening interval should be 2 or more years. The American Urological Association also notes that decisions about screening, including potentially starting screening before age 55 years, should be individual ones for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer. The American Cancer Society<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation43\"><span>43</span></a></sup> adopted detailed screening recommendations in 2016 that highlight the importance of shared decision making and the need for informed discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of screening. It recommends conversations about screening beginning at age 50 years and earlier for African American men and men with a father or brother with a history of prostate cancer before age 65 years.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation38\"><span>38</span></a></sup> on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. In 2012, the USPSTF concluded that, although there are potential benefits of screening for prostate cancer, these benefits do not outweigh the expected harms enough to recommend routine screening (D recommendation). The change in recommendation grade is based in part on additional evidence that increased the USPSTF&rsquo;s certainty about the reductions in risk of dying of prostate cancer and risk of metastatic disease. Longer-term follow-up of the ERSPC trial and from some ERSPC trial sites found that PSA-based screening for prostate cancer prevents 1.28 men from dying of prostate cancer for every 1000 men screened. In addition, a subset of ERSPC trial sites have since reported that screening 1000 men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 3 men from developing metastatic prostate cancer. Longer-term, 12.7-year results of the PIVOT trial became available since the posting of the draft recommendation statement and are similar to the 10-year results. Studies continue to demonstrate the harms of PSA-based screening, including false-positive results, complications from transrectal prostate biopsies, overdiagnosis (which may occur in 20%-50% of cases of screen-detected cancer, based on estimates from trial data), psychological harms, and harms of treatment, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The change in recommendation grade further reflects new evidence about and increased use of active surveillance of low-risk prostate cancer, which may reduce the risk of subsequent harms from screening. This recommendation also clearly identifies African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer as having higher risk for prostate cancer and provides additional information to help support these men in making informed decisions about screening. For the C recommendation for men aged 55 to 69 years, the USPSTF&rsquo;s intention is to convey that each man&rsquo;s values may shift the balance to a net benefit of screening and to promote the importance of informed decision making prior to screening. The USPSTF continues to find that the benefits of screening do not outweigh the harms in men 70 years and older and recommends against screening in these men.</p>",

Thus, some men randomized to active surveillance had an intermediate-grade tumor (or other tumor characteristics) such that they may not have been considered a candidate for active surveillance in some settings. The trial did not find a significant improvement in all-cause or prostate cancer mortality in any of the treatment groups. The unexpectedly high survival rate across the trial groups (99%) made any potential differences harder to detect. Longer-term follow-up studies may provide important additional information. The trial reported a significant reduction in progression to metastatic cancer when comparing both radical prostatectomy (61% reduction [95% CI, 27%-79%]) and radiation therapy (52% reduction [95% CI, 13%-73%]) with active surveillance. In the active surveillance group, 6.0% of men developed metastatic cancer, compared with 2.7% and 2.3% in the radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy groups, respectively. During the 10-year follow-up period, 54.8% of men randomized to active surveillance crossed over to active treatment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation15\"><span>15</span></a></sup></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>The other 2 randomized trials of radical prostatectomy took place prior to widespread PSA-based screening and thus recruited many men with tumors detected from clinical symptoms.

The magnitude of net benefit of PSA-based screening depends on how each man weighs the potential benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The value a man places on potential benefits and harms may also change over time.

A number of comments suggested that because men are now living longer, they should be screened beyond 70 years of age. However, the USPSTF considered other evidence in addition to data on life expectancy when recommending against screening in men older than 70 years, including results from large screening trials that did not report a mortality benefit for men older than 70 years and evidence on the increased likelihood of harm from screening, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Several comments requested a recommendation for younger men and for baseline PSA-based screening in men 40 years and older or 50 years and older. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening younger men or performing baseline PSA-based screening provides benefit.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Several comments asked for clarification about what new evidence led to the change from a D to a C grade. The new evidence included longer-term follow-up of the ERSPC trial and new data on reductions in risk of metastatic disease with screening. Although the added benefit reported from the additional follow-up to 13 years (from 10 years) in the ERSPC trial increased the number of lives saved from 1.07 to 1.28 (a small amount, according to some comments), these results gave the USPSTF more confidence that the benefit of screening could be greater over a 20- to 30-year period. Evidence newly considered since the draft recommendation statement was posted for comment includes the CAP trial, evidence on psychological harms, and longer-term follow-up of the PIVOT trial. This evidence led the USPSTF to continue to conclude that there is a small amount of benefit for some men. The USPSTF recognizes the importance of the potential harms of screening and treatment, including psychological harms and harms from active surveillance, and has added information about this evidence to the Rationale, Clinical Considerations, and Discussion sections. New evidence from the recently published CAP trial was added. Given the limitations of the CAP trial, including that it only examined 1-time PSA-based screening and the small difference between the percentage of men in the control and intervention groups (approximately 10%-15% vs 34%, respectively) who received PSA-based screening, the results of this trial did not change the USPSTF&rsquo;s overall assessment of the evidence and its recommendation.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by CVD risk assessment with tools such as the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations, which stratify individual risk to inform treatment decisions. If existing CVD risk assessment tools could be improved, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits of and minimizing the harms of screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether adding resting or exercise ECG to conventional risk factor assessment leads to improved risk stratification of persons to inform treatment decisions.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether the incremental information offered by resting or exercise ECG (beyond that obtained with traditional CVD risk factors) can be used to guide treatment decisions and ultimately reduce CVD events.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the epidemiology and natural history of CVD and established treatment strategies based on risk stratification, it is unlikely that the benefits of screening with resting or exercise ECG in asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events are greater than small.</p>\r\n<p>See the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#consider\">Clinical Considerations</a>&nbsp;section for definition of risk categories and assessment of risk.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening with resting or exercise ECG in asymptomatic adults leads to harms that are at least small and may be moderate, including unnecessary invasive procedures, overtreatment, and labeling.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG to prevent CVD events equal or exceed the potential benefits in asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to adults without symptoms of or a diagnosis of CVD.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen with resting or exercise ECG in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events, clinicians should consider the following information.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Although evidence is insufficient to determine whether screening with ECG in adults is beneficial, those who may be at increased risk of CVD events might have the greatest potential for net benefit. Reclassification into a higher-risk category might lead to more intensive medical management that could lower the risk of CVD events but might also result in harms, including adverse medication effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic injury. Regardless of ECG findings, persons who are already at high risk of CVD events should receive intensive risk factor modification. Persons who are classified as low risk are unlikely to benefit from screening with ECG.</p>\r\n<p>For persons in certain occupations, such as pilots and operators of heavy equipment, for whom sudden incapacitation or death may endanger the safety of others, considerations other than the health benefit to the patient may influence the decision to screen with ECG to prevent CVD events.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>In all risk groups, an abnormal ECG finding (a true-positive or false-positive result) can lead to invasive confirmatory testing and treatment that have the potential for serious harm, including unnecessary radiation exposure. Two studies of asymptomatic adults with diabetes reported that 6% and 12% of patients who were screened with exercise ECG subsequently underwent angiography, and 3% to 5% underwent revascularization, without evidence of benefit to the study patients.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Angiography and revascularization are associated with harms, including bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery dissection, allergic reaction to the contrast agent, and death.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Although many guideline groups recommend cardiovascular risk assessment, there are few data on how this is applied in clinical practice. Only 41% of respondents in a survey of more than 900 US clinicians reported using cardiovascular risk prediction equations in practice.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation3\">3</a></sup>There are few data on the use of ECG to assess CVD risk in asymptomatic patients in the United States. A Canadian retrospective cohort study from 2010 to 2015 found that 21.5% of low-risk primary care patients had an ECG within 30 days of an annual health examination, and the proportion of patients who had an ECG ranged across clinics from 1.8% to 76.1%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Accurate identification of persons at high risk of CVD events provides the opportunity for more intensive risk factor management to reduce the likelihood of such an event. In addition, identifying persons at low risk may allow for a reduction in interventions among patients not likely to benefit from them.</p>\r\n<p>Several factors are associated with an increased risk of CVD events, including older age, male sex, high blood pressure, current smoking, abnormal lipid levels, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Risk factors are combined in many ways to estimate a person's risk of a CVD event. Several calculators and models are available to quantify a person's 10-year risk of CVD events. The Framingham Risk Score,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation5\">5</a></sup>based on data from the Framingham Heart Study, was one of the first widely used CVD risk assessment tools. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk greater than 20% are generally considered high risk, those with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 10% are considered low risk, and those with a 10-year CVD event risk of 10% to 20% are considered intermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations, introduced by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association in 2013, include the same variables as the Framingham Risk Score as well as race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and those with a 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at elevated risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that clinicians use the Pooled Cohort Equations to assess CVD risk.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Both resting and exercise ECG are used for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected CVD, which has led to the suggestion that ECG could also be used to screen asymptomatic persons to identify those who would benefit from earlier, more intensive management of modifiable risk factors, preventive interventions, or both. Resting ECG records cardiac electrical activity while the patient is at rest, over a short period of time. Standard ECG testing is performed with 12 leads, although some tests use fewer leads. More recently, ECG leads have been built into blood pressure cuffs, smartphones, and other devices. Exercise ECG records cardiac electrical activity during physical exertion, often at a prespecified intensity level. The most common method of exercise ECG is the treadmill test, but other methods, such as those using bicycles and ergometers, have also been used.

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>By 2020, approximately 12.3 million individuals in the United States older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are associated with limitation of ambulation, chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life, and 21% to 30% of patients who experience a hip fracture die within 1 year.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Seventy-one percent of osteoporotic fractures occur among women,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;and women have higher rates of osteoporosis than men at any given age; however, men have a higher fracture-related mortality rate than women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The prevalence of primary osteoporosis (ie, osteoporosis without underlying disease) increases with age and differs by race/ethnicity. With the aging of the US population, the potential preventable burden is likely to increase in future years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men. The most commonly used test is central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the hip and lumbar spine. Although several bone measurement tests similarly predict risk of fracture, DXA provides measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), and most treatment guidelines use central DXA to define osteoporosis and the threshold at which to start drug therapies to prevent osteoporotic fractures. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 1 study that evaluated the effect of screening for osteoporosis on fracture rates; the study reported a reduction in hip fractures but did not find a reduction in other types of fractures.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4-6</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Multiple studies show that drug therapies reduce fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. For women 65 years and older, the USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening can detect osteoporosis and that treatment of women with osteoporosis can provide at least a moderate benefit in preventing fractures. For postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening can detect osteoporosis and that treatment provides a moderate benefit in preventing fractures.</p>\r\n<p>For men, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of treating screen-detected osteoporosis to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found a single study that described harms of screening for osteoporosis. It reported no increase in anxiety and no decrease in quality of life from screening.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4-6</a></sup>&nbsp;Based on the nature of screening with bone measurement tests and the low likelihood of serious harms, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound these harms as no greater than small. Harms associated with screening may include radiation exposure from DXA and opportunity costs (time and effort required by patients and the health care system).</p>\r\n<p>Harms of drug therapies for osteoporosis depend on the specific medication used. The USPSTF found that the risk of serious adverse events, upper gastrointestinal events, or cardiovascular events associated with the most common class of osteoporosis medication (bisphosphonates) is no greater than small. Overall, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of osteoporosis medications are small.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years and older is at least moderate.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis is at least moderate.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis in men.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to older adults without a history of low-trauma fractures and without conditions that may cause secondary osteoporosis (such as metabolic bone disease or untreated hyperthyroidism) and patients without conditions that may increase their risk of falls. This recommendation does not apply to persons who take long-term medications that may cause secondary osteoporosis (eg, glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists).</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding which postmenopausal women younger than 65 years to screen with bone measurement testing, clinicians should first consider factors associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. These include parental history of hip fracture, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and low body weight. In addition, menopausal status in women is also an important consideration because studies demonstrating treatment benefit mainly enrolled postmenopausal women. For postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have at least 1 risk factor, a reasonable approach to determine who should be screened with bone measurement testing is to use a clinical risk assessment tool.</p>\r\n<p>Several tools are available to assess osteoporosis risk: the Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE; Merck), Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI), Osteoporosis Index of Risk (OSIRIS), and the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST). These tools seem to perform similarly and are moderately accurate at predicting osteoporosis. The FRAX tool (University of Sheffield), which assesses a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of fracture, is also a commonly used tool. The FRAX tool includes questions about previous DXA results but does not require this information to estimate fracture risk. Because the benefits of treatment are greater in persons at higher risk of fracture, one approach is to perform bone measurement testing in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have a 10-year FRAX risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) (without DXA) greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman without major risk factors. For example, in the United States, a 65-year-old white woman of mean height and weight<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;without major risk factors has a 10-year FRAX risk of MOF of 8.4%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;In comparison, a 60-year-old white woman of mean height and weight<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;with a parental history of hip fracture has a 10-year FRAX risk of MOF of 13%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Clinicians should note that the presence of a given risk factor or a certain age does not represent a particular risk threshold. Although the risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures generally increases with age, the presence of multiple risk factors at a younger age may indicate that the risk-benefit profile is favorable for screening with bone measurement testing.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The most commonly used bone measurement test used to screen for osteoporosis is central DXA; other screening tests include peripheral DXA and quantitative ultrasound (QUS). Central DXA measures BMD at the hip and lumbar spine. Most treatment guidelines<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation9\">9-11</a></sup>recommend using BMD, as measured by central DXA, to define osteoporosis and the treatment threshold to prevent osteoporotic fractures.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;All the osteoporosis drug therapy studies reviewed by the USPSTF used central DXA to determine eligibility for study enrollment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Peripheral DXA measures BMD at the lower forearm and heel. Quantitative ultrasound also evaluates peripheral sites and has similar accuracy in predicting fracture risk as DXA, while avoiding the risk of radiation exposure; however, it does not measure BMD. Peripheral DXA and QUS are measured with portable devices and may be less costly and more accessible than central DXA measurement (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#tab1\">Table 1</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Some observational and modeling studies have suggested screening intervals based on age, baseline BMD, and calculated projected time to transition to osteoporosis. However, limited evidence from 2 good-quality studies found no benefit in predicting fractures from repeating bone measurement testing 4 to 8 years after initial screening.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved multiple drug therapies to reduce osteoporotic fractures, including bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, raloxifene, and estrogen. The choice of therapy should be an individual one based on the patient's clinical situation and the trade-off between benefits and harms. Clinicians should educate patients on how to minimize the adverse effects of drug therapies, such as reducing esophageal irritation from bisphosphonate therapy by taking the medication with a full glass of water and not lying down for at least 30 minutes afterward.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>When deciding whether to screen for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men, clinicians should consider the following factors.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Preventable Burden</h3>\r\n<p>The prevalence of osteoporosis in men is generally lower than in women (4.3% vs 15.4%, respectively).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;An estimated 1 to 2 million men in the United States have osteoporosis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Although men account for 29% of osteoporotic fractures in the United States, men have higher fracture-related morbidity and mortality rates than women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Each year, about 80,000 men in the United States will have a hip fracture; 1 in 3 men who experience a hip fracture will die within a year.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation13\">13</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Older age in men is an important risk factor for osteoporotic fracture. In the absence of other risk factors, it is not until age 80 years that the prevalence of osteoporosis in white men starts to reach that of white women at age 65 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;For example, in the United States, the 10-year FRAX risk of MOF is 5.0%<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;in a 65-year-old white man of mean height and weight<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;without any risk factors, and 8.4%<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;at age 80 years (vs 8.4% in a 65-year-old white woman of mean height and weight<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;without any risk factors<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup>). In the presence of multiple risk factors, the 10-year FRAX risk of MOF in a 55-year-old white man can approximate the risk of a 65-year-old white woman with no risk factors; for example, the 10-year FRAX risk of MOF is 8.9% in a 55-year-old white man of mean height and weight<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;with a parental history of hip fracture who currently smokes and drinks 3 or more units of alcohol per day.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Similar to women, risk factors for fractures in men include low body mass index, excessive alcohol consumption, current smoking, long-term corticosteroid use, previous fractures, and history of falls within the past year. A recent systematic review of risk factors for osteoporosis in men also found that hypogonadism, history of cerebrovascular accident, and history of diabetes are associated with an increased risk of fractures, although their clinical use in identifying men who need further bone measurement testing is unclear.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Although clinical risk assessment tools and imaging tests to diagnose osteoporosis seem to perform as well in men as in women, evidence on the effectiveness of medications to treat osteoporosis in men is lacking.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Although some treatments have been found to be effective in preventing fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, it cannot be assumed that they will be equally effective in men because the underlying biology of bones may differ in men due to differences in testosterone and estrogen levels. The review identified limited evidence on the effect of treatment of men with osteoporosis on the prevention of fractures.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;One good-quality study found a reduction in morphometric vertebral fractures but not clinical (vertebral and nonvertebral) fractures in men with osteoporosis who were treated with zoledronic acid.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation15\">15</a></sup>&nbsp;A small study examining treatment with parathyroid hormone in men was consistent in the direction of benefit but the finding was not statistically significant.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation16\">16</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly examined harms of screening in men. Potential harms of screening in men are likely to be similar to those in women. Evidence on harms of drug therapies in men is very limited.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Current Practice</h3>\r\n<p>Data on how frequently men are screened for osteoporosis are limited. Several organizations have issued statements on screening in men at increased risk. Progress toward the Healthy People 2020 objectives for osteoporosis have shown little change in the number of hip fracture hospitalizations among men (464.9 vs 442.6 hospitalizations per 100,000 men in 2000 and 2010, respectively).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation17\">17</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, engaging in 120 to 300 minutes of at least moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week can reduce the risk of hip fractures, and performing balance and muscle-strengthening activities each week along with moderate-intensity aerobic activity can help prevent falls in older adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;The National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) has issued dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D to support health; recommended daily allowances are based on age.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation19\">19</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources for Primary Care</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years and older at increased risk of falls and selectively offering multifactorial interventions based on circumstances of prior falls, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences; it recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;In a separate recommendation, the USPSTF recommends against supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium in postmenopausal women to prevent fractures.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation21\">21</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium, alone or combined, to prevent fractures in postmenopausal women, or at any dose in men and premenopausal women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation21\">21</a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Tools that can help identify women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis include SCORE, ORAI, OSIRIS, and OST.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation22\">22-26</a></sup>&nbsp;The most commonly used thresholds to identify increased risk of osteoporosis or osteoporotic fractures are greater than or equal to 6 for SCORE, greater than or equal to 9 for ORAI, less than 1 for OSIRIS, and less than 2 for OST (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#tab2\">Table 2</a>). Additionally, the FRAX tool<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup>is a computerized algorithm that calculates the 10-year probability of hip fracture and MOF using clinical risk factors. FRAX models are country specific, as they include country epidemiology. In the United States, the risk of MOF is 8.4% in a 65-year-old white woman of mean height and weight without any other risk factors.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation8\">8</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>The majority of reviewed studies focused on women.

The International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommends BMD testing in all women 65 years and older and all men 70 years and older. It also recommends BMD testing in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years and men younger than 70 years who have risk factors for low bone mass.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation39\">39</a></sup>&nbsp;As part of Choosing Wisely, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against DXA screening in women younger than 65 years and men younger than 70 years with no risk factors.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation40\">40</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2012 (and reaffirmed in 2014), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended BMD testing with DXA beginning at age 65 years in all women and selective screening in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have osteoporosis risk factors or an adult fracture.9 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists also recommends evaluating all women 50 years and older for osteoporosis risk and considering BMD testing based on clinical fracture risk profile.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;The Endocrine Society recommends screening in men older than 70 years and adults aged 50 to 69 years with significant risk factors or fracture after age 50 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation41\">41</a></sup><strong><br></strong></p>",

The number of adults 50 years and older with osteoporosis will increase from 10.2 million in 2010 to an estimated 12.3 million in 2020 and 13.6 million in 2030.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>Based on Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set data, the rate of women aged 65 to 85 years enrolled in Medicare who reported ever having a bone density test increased from 64.4% to 71.3% in 2006 and from 73.8% to 79.3% in 2016.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation30\">30</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In 2005, approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Nearly 40% of persons who experience a fracture are unable to walk independently at 1 year, and 60% require assistance with at least 1 essential activity of daily living.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation31\">31</a></sup>&nbsp;Hip fractures account for a large portion of the morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporotic fractures, with 21% to 30% of patients dying within 1 year of a hip fracture.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Osteoporosis is usually asymptomatic until a fracture occurs; preventing osteoporotic fractures is the main goal of an osteoporosis screening strategy.</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;to search for updated evidence since the previous review in 2011 and examine newer evidence on screening for and treatment of osteoporotic fractures in men and women. The review also sought evidence on risk assessment tools, screening intervals, and efficacy of screening and treatment in subgroups. The USPSTF defined the screening population as postmenopausal women and older men with no known previous osteoporotic fractures and no known comorbid conditions or medication use associated with secondary osteoporosis. The review excluded adults younger than 40 years as well as adults with no known conditions that may increase their risk of falls.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Clinical Risk Assessment Tools</h3>\r\n<h4>DXA</h4>\r\n<p>Bone measurement testing with central DXA is the most commonly used and studied method for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Central DXA uses radiation to measure BMD at central bone sites (hip and lumbar spine), which is the established standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis and for guiding decisions about treatment. DXA can also be used at peripheral bone sites (such as the lower forearm and heel) to identify persons with low bone mass; however, most treatment guidelines recommend follow-up with central DXA before initiating treatment for osteoporosis. Screening with peripheral DXA and other imaging techniques may help increase access to screening in geographic locations (eg, rural areas) where machines that perform central DXA may not be available. The USPSTF identified 2 studies (n = 712) that reported on the accuracy of peripheral DXA at the calcaneus to identify osteoporosis; compared with central DXA, the area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.67 to 0.80 in women with a mean age of 61 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation32\">32</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation33\">33</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>QUS</h4>\r\n<p>Quantitative ultrasound is another imaging technique used at peripheral bone sites (most commonly the calcaneus), and it does not require radiation exposure. Compared with central DXA, the AUC for QUS measured at the calcaneus in women ranged from 0.69 to 0.90, with a pooled estimate of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81; 7 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;1969).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;In men, the AUC ranged from 0.70 to 0.93, with a pooled estimate of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.94; 3 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;5142).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;However, QUS does not measure BMD, that is the current diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis. In addition, drug therapy trials for osteoporosis treatment generally use central DXA measurement of BMD as criteria for inclusion of study populations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;Thus, before QUS results could be routinely used to initiate treatment without any further DXA measurement, a method for converting or adapting QUS results to the DXA scale needs to be developed.</p>\r\n<h3>Clinical Risk Assessment Tools</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF evaluated the accuracy of clinical risk assessment tools to identify risk of osteoporosis. Many of these tools can also be used to calculate risk of future fractures; however, the USPSTF focused on their accuracy to identify osteoporosis because all the treatment studies evaluated by the USPSTF enrolled patients based on bone measurement testing, specifically central DXA measurement of BMD. The most frequently studied tools in women were the ORAI (10 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;16,780), OSIRIS (5 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;5649), OST (13 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;44,323), and SCORE (8 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;15,362). The pooled AUCs for these tools were all similar and ranged from 0.65 to 0.70. The FRAX tool (without BMD), which has been studied extensively as a clinical risk assessment tool to predict fracture risk, performs similarly in its ability to identify osteoporosis (AUC range, 0.58-0.82; 4 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;22,141).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;These clinical risk assessment tools could be applied to postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis to help clinicians determine who should be screened with bone measurement testing. Fewer studies are available that evaluate the performance of these tools specifically in younger women, and 1 study has suggested that FRAX is inferior to OST and SCORE in discriminating women with osteoporosis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation34\">34</a></sup>&nbsp;However, in the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, the range of AUCs of these tools (ORAI, OSIRIS, OST, SCORE, and FRAX) to identify osteoporosis in women younger than 65 years were similar to the pooled AUCs for women of all ages; the AUC from individual studies of clinical risk assessment tools in women younger than 65 years ranged from 0.58 to 0.85.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#tab2\">Table 2</a>&nbsp;provides more information on these clinical risk assessment tools and commonly used thresholds to determine risk of osteoporosis.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>A single fair-quality controlled study (n&#8197;=&#8197;12,483) evaluated the effect of screening for osteoporosis on fracture rates in postmenopausal women aged 70 to 85 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4-6</a></sup>&nbsp;This study reported no significant difference in the primary outcome of any osteoporotic fracture in women screened with FRAX vs women receiving usual care (12.9% vs 13.5%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.85-1.03]). There was also no significant difference for incidence of all clinical fractures (15.3% vs 16.0%; HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.86-1.03]) or mortality (8.8% vs 8.4%; HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.93-1.19]). However, the study reported a statistically significant reduction in hip fracture incidence (2.6% vs 3.5%; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.89]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4-6</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on drug therapies for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures. The vast majority of studies were conducted in postmenopausal women exclusively; only 2 studies were conducted in men.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Overall, the USPSTF found that drug therapies are effective in treating osteoporosis and reducing fractures in postmenopausal women.</p>\r\n<h4>Bisphosphonates</h4>\r\n<p>Bisphosphonates were studied most frequently; the USPSTF identified 7 studies on alendronate, 2 trials on zoledronic acid, 4 trials on risedronate, and 2 trials on etidronate.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;All but 1 study were conducted in postmenopausal women. For women, bisphosphonates were found to significantly reduce vertebral fractures (relative risk [RR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.41-0.78]; 5 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;5433) and nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76-0.92]; 8 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;16,438) but not hip fractures (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.44-1.11]; 3 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;8988).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;However, most studies reporting on hip fractures may have been underpowered to detect a difference in this outcome. In the single study of men (n&#8197;=&#8197;1199), zoledronic acid was found to reduce morphometric vertebral fractures (RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.16-0.70]) but not clinical nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.21-1.97]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation15\">15</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Raloxifene</h4>\r\n<p>Only 1 study (n&#8197;=&#8197;7705) on raloxifene met inclusion criteria for the review.

This study (n&#8197;=&#8197;7868) evaluated treatment with denosumab in women and found a significant reduction in vertebral fractures (RR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.26-0.41]), nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]), and hip fractures (RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation35\">35</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Parathyroid Hormone</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 2 trials on parathyroid hormone. One trial (n&#8197;=&#8197;2532) conducted in women found a significant reduction in vertebral fractures (RR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.14-0.75]) but not nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.71-1.33]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation36\">36</a></sup>&nbsp;The other trial, conducted in men, found a nonsignificant reduction in nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.11-3.83]) when comparing the FDA-approved dose of 20 &mu;g/d vs placebo (n&#8197;=&#8197;298).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation16\">16</a></sup>&nbsp;However, the number of fractures in the study was small and the study was stopped early due to concerns about osteosarcoma found in animal studies.</p>\r\n<h4>Estrogen</h4>\r\n<p>Although the USPSTF did not identify any studies on estrogen for the primary prevention of fractures that met inclusion criteria, the previous review found that estrogen reduces vertebral fractures based on data from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative trial.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>One trial evaluated the effect of screening on anxiety and quality of life and found no difference between screened and unscreened intervention groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4-6</a></sup>&nbsp;Additional potential harms of screening for osteoporosis include false-positive test results, which can lead to unnecessary treatment, and false-negative test results. The USPSTF did review several studies that reported on harms of various osteoporosis medications.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Overall, the USPSTF determined that the potential harms of osteoporosis drug therapies are small.</p>\r\n<h4>Bisphosphonates</h4>\r\n<p>Similar to the evidence on the benefits of drug therapy for the primary prevention of fractures, the most available evidence on the harms is for bisphosphonates. The USPSTF identified 16 studies on alendronate, 4 studies on zoledronic acid, 6 studies on risedronate, 2 studies on etidronate, and 7 studies on ibandronate that reported on harms. Overall, based on pooled analyses, studies on bisphosphonates showed no increased risk of discontinuation (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.91-1.07]; 20 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;17,369), serious adverse events (RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.92-1.04]; 17 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;11,745), or upper gastrointestinal events (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.98-1.05]; 13 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;20,485).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Evidence on bisphosphonates and cardiovascular events is more limited and generally shows no significant difference or nonsignificant increases in atrial fibrillation with bisphosphonate therapy. Concerns have been raised about osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fractures of the femur with bisphosphonate therapy. The USPSTF found only 3 studies that reported on osteonecrosis of the jaw, and none of these studies found any cases.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The previous review<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;noted an FDA case series that reported on osteonecrosis of the jaw with bisphosphonate use in patients with cancer. A more recent systematic review that did not meet inclusion criteria (because it included populations with a previous fracture) found higher incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw with intravenous bisphosphonate use and with longer use. No studies that met inclusion criteria for the current review reported on atypical fractures of the femur, although some studies and systematic reviews that did not meet inclusion criteria (because of wrong study population, study design, or intervention comparator) reported an increase in atypical femur fractures with bisphosphonate use. No studies reported any cases of kidney failure, although the FDA has added a warning label noting that zoledronic acid is contraindicated in certain patients. Three trials that reported on harms of bisphosphonates included men (either combining results for men and women or including men only); results were consistent with those of women for risk of discontinuation, serious adverse events, and upper gastrointestinal events.</p>\r\n<h4>Raloxifene</h4>\r\n<p>Six trials of raloxifene therapy in women reported on various harms.

However, based on findings from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative trial, the previous review found an increased rate of gallbladder events, stroke, and venous thromboembolism with estrogen therapy, and an increased risk of urinary incontinence during 1 year of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;Women taking combined estrogen and progestin had an increased risk of invasive breast cancer, coronary heart disease, probable dementia, gallbladder events, stroke, and venous thromboembolism compared with women taking placebo, and an increased risk of urinary incontinence during 1 year of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/osteoporosis-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for detecting osteoporosis and predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that drug therapies reduce subsequent fracture rates in postmenopausal women. The benefit of treating screen-detected osteoporosis is at least moderate in women 65 years and older and in younger postmenopausal women who have similar fracture risk. The harms of treatment range from no greater than small for bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone to small to moderate for raloxifene and estrogen. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for osteoporosis in these groups of women is at least moderate. The single study that directly evaluated the effect of screening (with FRAX) on fracture outcomes was generally consistent with this conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found that the evidence is inadequate to assess the effectiveness of drug therapies in reducing subsequent fracture rates in men without previous fractures. Treatments that have been proven effective in women cannot necessarily be presumed to have similar effectiveness in men, and the direct evidence is too limited to draw definitive conclusions. Thus, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis in men.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Low bone density is a risk factor for fractures, especially in older adults. Screening for low BMD and subsequent treatment can result in increased BMD and decrease the risk of subsequent fractures and fracture-related morbidity and mortality. Most evidence supports screening for and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women; the evidence for primary prevention in men is lacking, and future research is needed. It cannot be assumed that the bones of men and women are biologically the same, especially because bone density is affected by differing levels and effects of testosterone and estrogen in men and women. Moreover, rapid bone loss occurs in women due to the loss of estrogen during menopause. Men tend to experience fractures at an older age than women, when risk of comorbid conditions and overall mortality are higher; thus, the net balance of benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of osteoporosis in men is unclear.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 7, 2017, to December 4, 2017. In response to comments, the USPSTF added information on the accuracy of certain clinical risk assessment tools to identify osteoporosis in women younger than 65 years to the Discussion section. In addition, the USPSTF clarified that adults with certain conditions that may increase their risk of falls or those using certain medications (such as aromatase inhibitors) that may increase one&rsquo;s risk of fractures are excluded from this recommendation. Some comments expressed concern that the USPSTF did not recommend screening for osteoporosis in men. Although the USPSTF agrees that prevention of osteoporotic fractures in men is an important public health issue, there is currently not enough evidence demonstrating that screening for and subsequent treatment of osteoporosis in men prevents primary fractures. Studies that have evaluated screening and treatment in men have focused on populations that are out of scope for this recommendation, such as men with a history of previous fractures or men taking certain medications that may cause secondary osteoporosis. The USPSTF is calling for more research in osteoporosis screening and treatment in men, and clarified why it found the evidence insufficient to make a recommendation for or against screening in men. Last, the USPSTF updated the recommendation to include information from a recent trial that evaluated the direct effect of screening for osteoporosis on the incidence of fractures.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States. Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models (Framingham Risk Score [which estimates a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of coronary heart disease] or Pooled Cohort Equations [which estimate 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, death from coronary heart disease, or stroke]) may improve calibration (agreement between observed and predicted outcomes), discrimination (ability to distinguish between people who will and will not experience an event), and reclassification (ability to correctly reassign people into clinically meaningful risk strata ). The USPSTF chose to review these 3 nontraditional risk factors because prior evidence reviews identified them as the most promising to improve on existing CVD risk assessment tools.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Risk Assessment and Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score test results, when added to existing CVD risk assessment models, lead to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Risk Assessment and Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of risk assessment and intervention as small. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms. Harms can include abnormal test results, inappropriate risk reclassification, and incidental findings leading to additional testing and possible procedures, as well as anxiety.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>Although in the United States both the Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations are used in practice, the USPSTF recommends that clinicians use the Pooled Cohort Equations to assess CVD risk and to guide treatment decisions until further evidence shows additional benefit of adding other CVD risk factors.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Preventable Burden</h3>\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease comprises diseases of the heart and vascular system, including atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease. It is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths each year.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation1\">1</a></sup>Although CVD remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, CVD mortality has been decreasing over time in the United States. Currently, the annual incidence of new cases of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident in the United States is 580,000 and 610,000, respectively.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The incidence of CVD varies by sex. Men, on average, develop CVD about 10 years earlier than women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;The burden of CVD increases with age. In 2015, the age-adjusted prevalence of coronary artery disease among US adults aged 45 to 64 years was 6.1%, compared with 16.4% among those aged 65 to 74 years and 23.3% among those 75 years or older.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;In the same year, 2.7%, 5.6%, and 11.2% of US adults in these age groups, respectively, experienced a stroke. Prevalence also varies by race/ethnicity; in 2015, the prevalence of coronary artery disease was 2 times greater among American Indian/Alaskan Native adults than Asian adults (9.3% vs 3.7%, respectively). Prevalence in Hispanic, African American, and white adults was similar, at 5.1%, 5.4%, and 5.6%, respectively.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;However, strokes were most common among African American adults (3.7%), followed by white (2.4%), Hispanic (2.4%), American Indian/Alaska Native (2.2%), and Asian (1.4%) adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms</h3>\r\n<p>Testing for hsCRP level and the ABI is noninvasive, and there is little direct harm from the tests. Harms of testing for CAC score include exposure to radiation and incidental findings on computed tomography of the chest, such as pulmonary nodules, that may lead to further invasive testing and procedures. Abnormal test results may lead to further testing, procedures, and lifelong medication use without proof of benefit but with expense and potential adverse effects for the patient. Psychological harms may result from reclassification into a higher-risk category for CVD events.</p>\r\n<h3>Current Practice</h3>\r\n<p>Only 1 of the risk assessment models currently used in the United States, the Reynolds Risk Score, incorporates hsCRP level into its risk calculation. A number of guidelines, including those from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, recommend considering hsCRP level, the ABI, or CAC score to clarify treatment decisions for patients whose risk assessment is borderline or unclear using a traditional risk assessment model.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Accurate identification of persons at high risk for CVD events, particularly nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, and CVD death provides the opportunity for more intensive risk factor management to reduce the likelihood of such an event. In addition, identifying persons at low risk may allow for a reduction in interventions with a low benefit to risk ratio for those not likely to benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Several traditional risk factors are associated with higher risk for CVD events, including older age, male sex, high blood pressure, current smoking, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Risk factors can be combined in many ways to classify a person&rsquo;s risk for a CVD event as low, intermediate, or high. Several calculators and models are available to quantify a person&rsquo;s 10-year CVD event risk. The Framingham Risk Score (which estimates a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of coronary heart disease) was 1 of the first widely used risk assessment tools. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk greater than 20% are generally considered at high risk, those with a 10-year risk less than 10% are considered at low risk, and those in the 10% to 20% range are considered at intermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations (which estimate 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, death from coronary heart disease, or stroke) were introduced in 2013 and were developed using more contemporary and diverse cohort data, with the inclusion of race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and those with a 10-year risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at high risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The distribution of estimated CVD risk in the US population is highly influenced by age and sex. Population estimates of the distribution of 10-year CVD event risk assessed by the Pooled Cohort Equations, which categorize risk using somewhat different thresholds, and using 2001-2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that the vast majority of US adults aged 40 to 49 years have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less (93% of women and 81% of men). Among US adults aged 50 to 59 years, 80% of women and 46% of men have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less; 42% of women and 7% of men aged 60 to 69 years have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation5\">5</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease risk assessment in the United States has been generally based on the Framingham Risk Score and, more recently, the Pooled Cohort Equations. However, both have been documented to overestimate and underestimate risk in some persons. Therefore, identification of additional tests (for nontraditional risk factors) that could improve risk prediction, including the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score, is of interest.</p>\r\n<p>The ABI is the ratio of the systolic blood pressure at the ankle (measuring the pressure proximal to the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery) to the systolic blood pressure at the brachial artery. A value less than 0.9 indicates peripheral artery disease.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation6\">6</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>High-sensitivity C-reactive protein is a serum protein involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Testing for hsCRP level involves a single blood sample, and the test is widely available. A threshold of greater than 2 or 3 mg/L is used in clinical practice to signify increased cardiovascular risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation7\">7-9</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Coronary artery calcium score is obtained by electron-beam or multidetector computed tomography, which measure the calcium content in the coronary arteries. Scoring systems and thresholds for an elevated CAC score vary across studies, but the baseline comparison is often a CAC score of 0.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation10\">10</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Asymptomatic adults at increased risk for CVD are usually treated with a combination of diet and exercise modifications, statins, aspirin, blood pressure management, and smoking cessation interventions.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute provides resources on cardiovascular risk assessment, including a link to an online version of the Pooled Cohort Equations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation11\">11</a></sup>&nbsp;Healthy People 2020 provides a database of evidence-based resources for achieving Healthy People 2020 goals, including interventions to prevent CVD.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation12\">12</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on many factors related to CVD prevention, including screening for high blood pressure,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;statin use,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;counseling on smoking cessation,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation15\">15</a></sup>&nbsp;counseling on healthful diet and physical activity,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation16\">16</a></sup>&nbsp;and screening for peripheral artery disease and CVD risk assessment with the ABI.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition, the USPSTF recommends low-dose aspirin use in certain persons at increased risk for CVD.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation18\">18</a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations:</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>A substantial number of studies demonstrate an association between the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score and cardiovascular outcomes, so additional association studies are unlikely to add more information. Similarly, studies assessing nontraditional risk factors in isolation are of limited value, given that current treatment recommendations are based on risk assessment with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations. Good-quality studies comparing traditional risk assessment with traditional risk assessment plus the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC scores are needed to measure the effect of adding nontraditional risk factors on clinical decision thresholds and patient outcomes (CVD events and mortality). Studies are especially needed in more diverse populations (women, racial/ethnic minorities, persons of lower socioeconomic status), in whom assessment of nontraditional risk factors may help address the shortcomings of traditional risk models. In addition, well-designed prospective studies reflective of real-world practice are needed to identify the downstream effects of CAC score on additional testing and procedures.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of a Previous Recommendation</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation replaces the 2009 USPSTF recommendation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;The previous recommendation considered the evidence on the addition of several risk factors to the Framingham Risk Score.

The USPSTF found 10 articles representing 22 cohorts for the ABI, 25 articles representing 49 cohorts for hsCRP level, and 19 articles representing 10 cohorts for CAC score, although few studies reported all 3 measures; most did not use the published versions of the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations as the base model.</p>\r\n<p>In general, all cohort studies examining calibration (5 for the ABI, 9 for hsCRP level, and 8 for CAC score) found that adding 1 of these 3 nontraditional risk factors improved calibration, although preferred measures of calibration were rarely reported and only 1 study (of CAC score) used the Pooled Cohort Equations as a base model. The calibration plots available for hsCRP demonstrate that, although adding hsCRP level improved calibration for some groups, it worsened calibration for others.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation22\">22</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;An individual patient data meta-analysis of 18 cohorts found that the ABI improved discrimination when added to the Framingham Risk Score, but only for women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;A separate analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort (which was not included in the individual patient data meta-analysis) found no improvement from adding the ABI to the Pooled Cohort Equations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Evidence (25 studies) for adding hsCRP was inconsistent, showing at most a small improvement in discrimination.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;In the only study that added hsCRP to the Pooled Cohort Equations (MESA), hsCRP level did not improve discrimination.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Adding CAC score (18 studies) to various risk assessment models resulted in at least a small, and often larger, improvement in discrimination.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;However, the magnitude of improvement decreased as the discrimination of the base model improved. Four studies<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation25\">25-28</a></sup>&nbsp;that added CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations found a very small to small improvement (0.02-0.04) to the area under the curve.</p>\r\n<p>The evidence for risk reclassification was largely similar to the evidence for discrimination. Different studies used different risk strata, but those that used the Framingham Risk Score as the base model generally used less than 10% for low risk, 10% to 20% for intermediate risk, and greater than 20% for high risk, while studies using the Pooled Cohort Equations as the base model used greater than 7.5% for increased risk. In general, studies found that the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score tended to have positive event net reclassification (ie, more persons who had a CVD event were correctly reclassified to a higher-risk category than were incorrectly reclassified to a lower-risk category). The ABI (in women) and CAC score tended to have negative nonevent net reclassification (ie, more persons who did not have a CVD event were incorrectly reclassified to a higher-risk category than were correctly reclassified to a lower-risk category). Because only a few persons in the general population have CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD death) in a given period, this suggests that on balance, more persons would be inappropriately than appropriately reclassified.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation7\">7</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Risk Assessment and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found only 1 study that directly assessed the potential benefit on clinical outcomes of adding 1 of these 3 nontraditional risk factors to traditional risk assessment models.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation29\">29</a></sup>&nbsp;This fair-quality randomized clinical trial (RCT) assigned asymptomatic volunteers (N&#8197;=&#8197;2137) with no history of CVD to CAC scoring plus risk factor assessment counseling vs risk factor assessment counseling alone. At 4 years, there was no difference in CVD outcomes between the 2 groups; however, the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in patient health outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation29\">29</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the incremental benefit on health outcomes of adding the ABI or hsCRP level to traditional risk factor assessment. The Viborg Vascular (VIVA) screening trial<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation30\">30</a></sup>&nbsp;recently reported interim results; this trial randomized men aged 65 to 74 years to invitation for a triple screening (screening for high blood pressure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and peripheral artery disease using the ABI) or no screening and found a decrease in mortality with screening; however, it was not possible to determine how much of the decrease was attributable to screening for peripheral artery disease and how much was attributable to screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and high blood pressure, both of which are already recommended screenings.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no trials evaluating the additional benefit of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment models for guiding decisions about specific interventions to prevent CVD. The USPSTF found a few studies evaluating the use of a nontraditional risk factor as a single intervention to guide decisions about specific preventive medications compared with usual care. Two RCTs (total N&#8197;=&#8197;4626) compared using the ABI to guide decisions to start aspirin therapy vs usual care and found no benefit in CVD outcomes at 7 years of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation31\">31</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation32\">32</a></sup>&nbsp;However, both studies used atypical cutoff points for diagnosing peripheral artery disease, and the results may not be applicable to current practice. One RCT (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin [JUPITER]; N&#8197;=&#8197;17,802) compared hsCRP screening vs usual care to guide high-intensity statin therapy and found benefit at 1.9 years of follow-up in the reduction of CVD events in the hsCRP group.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;However, because the study only randomized persons with elevated hsCRP levels, it is not known whether patients with lower hsCRP levels would also have benefited from high-intensity statin therapy. Further, many of these patients met criteria for statin therapy based on traditional CVD risk assessment and would already have been candidates for treatment. One study (n&#8197;=&#8197;1005) of using CAC score to guide statin therapy found no benefit at 4 years in the reduction of CVD events.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation33\">33</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>A systematic review that addressed the effect of screening with CAC score on risk perception, adherence to medication, and behavioral therapies found only 2 studies comparing traditional CVD risk assessment vs CAC score. Neither of these studies found that screening with CAC score was superior to traditional CVD risk assessment for preventive medication use or risk factor management.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation5\">5</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The main potential harm of adding nontraditional risk factors to CVD risk assessment is radiation exposure from CAC score testing, although the dosage (0.4 to 2.1 mSv) is relatively low.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;More general potential harms are false-positive test results and subsequent invasive diagnostic procedures (such as coronary angiography). Three studies assessing the effect of CAC score on health care utilization found conflicting results. The Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis by Noninvasive Imaging Research (EISNER) study, an RCT of CAC score use in an academic setting, found no statistically significant increase in downstream cardiac testing and procedures.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation29\">29</a></sup>&nbsp;In contrast, a retrospective study of Medicare data found that use of CAC score increased downstream cardiac testing and procedures compared with use of hsCRP and lipid screening,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation34\">34</a></sup>&nbsp;while a second smaller observational study found no difference.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation35\">35</a></sup>&nbsp;A systematic review of 7 studies found that the prevalence of incidental findings on computed tomography for CAC score ranged from 8% to 58%.

However, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is sparse, which makes it difficult to infer the clinical significance of these findings. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. Few studies were available and were either underpowered or used atypical test thresholds for intervention. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 16, 2018, to February 12, 2018. Many comments expressed belief that the evidence for risk assessment with CAC score was strong enough to warrant a separate positive recommendation. Although adding CAC score to traditional risk assessment models improved discrimination and reclassification, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence that this change would translate into improved health outcomes among asymptomatic patients.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments expressed concern that the USPSTF overestimated the harms associated with CAC score testing (radiation exposure, downstream testing). The USPSTF added language to clarify that it determined that the harms associated with the addition of nontraditional risk factors, including CAC score, are small in magnitude.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments noted that the addition of nontraditional risk factors, especially CAC score, is useful for patients whose risk stratification is unclear or for those who fall into intermediate-risk groups. The USPSTF did not find convincing evidence that adding nontraditional risk factors to traditional risk factors improves reclassification in intermediate-risk groups. As clinical practice moves toward a single threshold for treatment, this concern may no longer be relevant in clinical decision making. Some comments also expressed belief that CAC score testing leads to better adherence to preventive therapies (ie, medications and lifestyle changes). The USPSTF carefully reviewed the available evidence and concluded that CAC score testing showed no benefit over traditional CVD risk assessment in preventive medication use or risk factor control. The USPSTF added language to address this point.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments recommended including more information on the differences between the Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations as well as population distribution of risk. The USPSTF included information in the Clinical Considerations section to clarify these differences and provide more information on risk in the general US population. Last, comments noted that the USPSTF assessment may not be applicable across sex, race/ethnicity, family history, and socioeconomic status. The USPSTF included language indicating the need for more studies in these subpopulations.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Peripheral artery disease is a manifestation of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs. It can impair walking and, in severe cases, can lead to tissue loss, infection, and amputation. In addition to morbidity directly caused by PAD, patients with PAD are at increased risk for CVD events, because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that also causes coronary and cerebrovascular events. The most recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004) show that 5.9% of the US population 40 years or older has a low ABI (&le;0.9), which indicates the presence of PAD. The true prevalence of PAD is difficult to establish, because more than half of persons with a low ABI are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms and because population screening studies that use a gold standard diagnostic test are lacking.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons with PAD who can benefit from treatment.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether screening for and treatment of PAD in asymptomatic patients leads to clinically important benefits in either preventing the progression of PAD or preventing CVD events.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the direct harms of screening, beyond the time needed for testing, are minimal. Other harms may include false-positive test results, exposure to gadolinium or contrast dye if magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) is used to confirm a diagnosis of PAD, anxiety, labeling, and opportunity costs. If a low ABI finding prompts further evaluation for CVD, harms could include those attributable to stress testing and angiography. The harms of preventive treatment for PAD or CVD include bleeding (with aspirin use) and possibly diabetes (with statin use).</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ABI in asymptomatic adults.</p>",

Data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that 5.9% of the US population 40 years or older (7.1 million adults) has a low ABI (&le;0.9), which may indicate the presence of PAD.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The most recent prevalence data available are from a screening trial of Danish men aged 65 to 74 years, which identified a prevalence of 11% when PAD was defined as an ABI less than 0.9 or greater than 1.4. Two-thirds of identified patients reported no intermittent claudication, which is considered to be the classic symptom of PAD.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>A 2016 systematic review<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;found that over 5 years of follow-up, approximately 7% of patients with asymptomatic PAD developed intermittent claudication and approximately 21% of patients with intermittent claudication progressed to critical limb ischemia. In addition to the risk of worsening symptoms in the lower limbs, a low ABI is associated with increased risk of CVD events. Studies suggest that the 5-year cumulative incidence of cardiovascular mortality is 9% (95% CI, 7%-12%) in asymptomatic patients with a low ABI and 13% (95% CI, 9%-17%) in symptomatic patients with a low ABI; patients with a normal ABI had an average incidence of 5% (95% CI, 4%-6%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Although minimal harms are associated with the ABI test, subsequent harms are possible. False-positive test results, false-negative test results, anxiety, labeling, and exposure to gadolinium or contrast dye from confirmatory MRA or CTA may occur, while further evaluation of CVD risk may involve stress testing or angiography. If the ABI is used to determine the need for pharmacologic treatment to reduce CVD risk, patients could receive additional treatment with resulting adverse effects or be reclassified to a lower risk category and potentially discontinue treatment that may be beneficial.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>An older study of US primary care practices found that 12% to 13% reported using the ABI for CVD screening weekly or monthly, 6% to 8% reported using it annually, and 68% reported never using it. However, the study was conducted more than a decade ago and may not reflect current practice.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation5\">5</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to older age, major risk factors for PAD include diabetes, current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, obesity, and physical inactivity, with current smoking and diabetes showing the strongest association.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Although women have a slightly lower ABI compared with men, the prevalence of low ABI does not appear to vary significantly by sex after adjusting for age.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Among healthy US men aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD, the risk for PAD over 25 years in the absence of 4 conventional cardiovascular risk factors (current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, or type 2 diabetes) is rare (9 cases per 100,000 men per year). These 4 risk factors account for 75% of all cases of PAD, and at least 1 of these risk factors is present at the time of PAD diagnosis in 96% of men.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation7\">7</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Resting ABI is the most commonly used measurement for detection of PAD in clinical settings, although variation in measurement protocols may lead to differences in the ABI values obtained. Ankle-brachial index is calculated as the systolic blood pressure obtained at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure obtained at the brachial artery while the patient is lying down. A ratio of less than 1 (typically defined as &lt;0.9) is considered abnormal and is commonly used to define PAD. Data on the accuracy of the ABI in asymptomatic populations are limited. One study of men and women older than 70 years reported that an ABI of less than 0.9 had a sensitivity of 15% to 20% and a specificity of 99% compared with whole-body MRA.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation8\">8</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;Physical examination has low sensitivity for detecting mild PAD in asymptomatic persons.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Although femoral bruit (vascular murmur at the femoral artery), pulse abnormalities, or ischemic skin changes significantly increase the likelihood ratio for low ABI (&le;0.9), these signs indicate moderate to severe obstruction of blood flow or clinical disease.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;The clinical benefits and harms of screening for PAD with a physical examination have not been well evaluated, although such screening is often performed.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Because PAD is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, treatment of PAD has 2 potential targets: reducing morbidity and mortality from lower limb ischemia and preventing CVD events due to systemic atherosclerosis. Treatment of PAD focuses on improving outcomes in symptomatic patients (eg, increasing walking distance and quality of life by improving symptoms of intermittent claudication and leg function, preventing or reducing limb complications, and preserving limb viability). Interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy.

One ongoing study in Denmark has published preliminary results; however, that study limited enrollment to men aged 65 to 74 years and included screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and high blood pressure, making it difficult to evaluate the benefit of screening with the ABI alone.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Two other ongoing trials that include the ABI as part of a screening bundle may have the same limitation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation21\">21</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation22\">22</a></sup>&nbsp;Future studies, in addition to isolating the effect of individual tests, should address the population of persons at potentially increased risk for PAD who are not already receiving interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk, because this is the population most likely to benefit from an additional screening intervention. Studies of screening with the ABI and interventions to stop disease progression in the lower limbs in more diverse populations (eg, women, racial/ethnic minorities, or persons with a lower socioeconomic status) and populations at high risk (ie, persons with diabetes) would also be valuable.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of Previous TF Recommendations</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation replaces the 2013 USPSTF recommendation. Although the USPSTF expanded its evidence review to include a broader population and range of interventions, the USPSTF&rsquo;s recommendation remains an I statement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released joint practice guidelines recommending screening with the ABI in patients at increased risk, including adults 65 years or older, adults 50 years or older with risk factors for atherosclerosis or a family history of PAD, and adults younger than 50 years with diabetes and 1 other risk factor for atherosclerosis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation31\">31</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2015, the Society for Vascular Surgery recommended against screening with the ABI in adults in the absence of risk factors, history, signs, or symptoms of PAD; however, screening is considered reasonable in adults at higher risk (defined as age older than 70 years, current smoking, or diabetes; abnormal pulse examination; or other established CVD).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation32\">32</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2013, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ABI in asymptomatic adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation33\">33</a></sup></p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>The most recent data (1999-2004) show that 5.9% of US adults 40 years or older have a low ABI.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;In the United States, a low ABI (typically &lt;0.9) is considered diagnostic for PAD in clinical practice, especially in the presence of symptoms. However, evidence that the ABI is an accurate screening test in asymptomatic adults is limited, so the actual prevalence of PAD is not known. When persons with known coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease are excluded, the reported prevalence of PAD in studies is 4.7%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Prevalence is higher in older populations; the prevalence of low ABI is 1.9% in adults aged 40 to 59 years, 8.1% in those aged 60 to 74 years, and 17.5% in those 75 years or older.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;However, the natural history of screen-detected PAD, including the development of morbidity and mortality directly related to atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, is not well known. Therefore, the true burden of asymptomatic PAD is difficult to determine.</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening for PAD with the ABI in generally asymptomatic adults reduces morbidity or mortality from PAD or CVD. The current review expanded on the previous review to include persons with diabetes and interventions that include supervised exercise and physical therapy intended to improve outcomes in the lower limbs.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF also considered in a separate review whether the ABI improves CVD risk prediction when added to current risk assessment models (ie, Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation25\">25</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>In practice, low ABI is used as a surrogate marker for PAD; however, its accuracy as a screening tool for PAD in asymptomatic primary care populations has not been well studied. Only 1 fair-quality study evaluated the ABI as a screening test compared with a reference standard in a relevant population.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;That study was conducted in Sweden and included 306 participants, all of whom were aged 70 years at study entry. The mean interval between the ABI and the reference standard (whole-body MRA) was 16 months. The prevalence of PAD detected by MRA in the study population was relatively high at 28%. When whole-body MRA showing at least 50% stenosis in the pelvic or lower-limb arteries was used as the reference standard, an ABI of less than 0.9 had a sensitivity of 15% to 20% and a specificity of 99%. Because of its low sensitivity and high specificity, the positive and negative predictive values for the ABI in this study were 82% to 83% and 80% to 84%, respectively, depending on the leg. There were no subgroup analyses to examine whether accuracy results varied by subpopulation. The previous USPSTF review used evidence in symptomatic adults to assess the potential accuracy of the ABI in asymptomatic patients; the current review did not reassess this literature. Although studies of test performance in symptomatic patients are helpful, asymptomatic patients may have less severe disease than symptomatic patients, so it is uncertain whether the sensitivity and specificity of the ABI found in studies of symptomatic patients would be applicable to asymptomatic patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no population-based, randomized trials of the effect of PAD screening alone. One study, the Viborg Vascular (or VIVA) screening trial, assessed the effects of a screening bundle (combined screening for PAD, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and high blood pressure), reporting an absolute reduction in mortality of 0.006 (95% CI, 0.001-0.011) in the screening group at 5 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation26\">26</a></sup>&nbsp;However, the applicability of these results to screening for PAD in the United States is uncertain, given that the contribution of the individual tests was not measured and that screening for high blood pressure is supported by evidence-based guidelines in the United States, as is screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in selected high-risk populations.</p>\r\n<p>Four studies, 2 of aspirin therapy and 2 of exercise therapy, addressed treatment of asymptomatic patients with low ABI or PAD. Both aspirin studies were large, good-quality, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that addressed whether asymptomatic men and women with low ABI (defined as &le;0.95 and &le;0.99, respectively) could benefit from daily aspirin therapy (100 mg/d). One study, Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis (N&#8197;=&#8197;3350), enrolled men and women aged 50 to 75 years, with a mean follow-up of 8.2 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation27\">27</a></sup>&nbsp;The second study, the Prevention of Progression of Arterial Disease and Diabetes (POPADAD) trial (N&#8197;=&#8197;1276), enrolled patients 40 years or older with diabetes, with a median follow-up of 6.7 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation28\">28</a></sup>&nbsp;Neither study showed any significant difference in CVD events or mortality. Both studies reported no significant differences in development of intermittent claudication, and the POPADAD trial found no significant difference in PAD revascularization, bypass surgery, angioplasty, or amputation. In terms of subgroups analysis, there did not appear to be a difference in treatment effect based on age or sex.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The 2 exercise studies were a small (N&#8197;=&#8197;50), fair-quality US-based RCT with 12 weeks of follow-up<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation29\">29</a></sup>&nbsp;and a good-quality Australian RCT (n&#8197;=&#8197;882) with 1 year of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation30\">30</a></sup>&nbsp;The intervention in both trials was a combination of risk factor modification and measures to increase physical activity. One-fourth of the participants in the US study and slightly more than half of the participants in the Australian study were asymptomatic. Both studies found no statistically significant differences in their primary outcome of walking distance or secondary outcomes of quality of life or self-reported symptoms, although the US study reported an improvement only in the mean stair climbing component of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation29\">29</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation30\">30</a></sup>&nbsp;There was no difference in development of PAD symptoms or improvement in quality of life. There was no evidence addressing whether subpopulations at greater risk for PAD had a differential treatment effect.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies directly addressed the harms of screening for PAD with the ABI. Harms resulting from testing may include false-positive test results (about 1%), false-negative test results (80% to 85%), exposure to gadolinium or contrast dye from confirmatory MRA or CTA, anxiety, labeling, and opportunity costs.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The time and resources needed to screen with the ABI in a primary care setting may detract from other prevention activities that may have more benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Two trials addressed the harms of aspirin treatment in asymptomatic persons. The Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis trial reported a nonsignificant trend toward increased major bleeding events requiring hospitalization in the aspirin therapy vs placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.99-2.97]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation27\">27</a></sup>&nbsp;The POPADAD trial reported a numerical decrease in hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents in the aspirin group, but the results were imprecise and not statistically significant.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index#citation28\">28</a></sup>&nbsp;The 2 exercise trials did not report on harms.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found few data on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons who can benefit from treatment of PAD or CVD. Studies addressing the benefits of treating screen-detected patients with PAD are sparse; 2 good-quality studies showed no benefit of using the ABI to manage daily aspirin therapy in unselected populations, and 2 studies showed no benefit from exercise therapy. No studies addressed the harms of screening, although the potential exists for overdiagnosis, labeling, and opportunity costs. Studies that addressed the harms of treatment showed nonsignificant results. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD with the ABI in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Peripheral artery disease is generally considered a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. Detection when a patient is asymptomatic may suggest significant atherosclerosis in other vessels, such as the heart or brain, and patients may therefore be at risk for types of CVD other than PAD. Early detection and intervention to reduce atherosclerotic progression and prevent future CVD events could improve health outcomes compared with intervention strategies used in the absence of PAD screening. Patients with minimal or atypical symptoms may limit activity to avoid symptoms, leading to further deterioration. In this case, screening and treatment could theoretically prevent deterioration. However, a substantial number of asymptomatic persons with low ABI may never develop clinical signs or symptoms of CVD or PAD but would still be subjected to the harms of testing and subsequent treatments.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 16, 2018, to February 12, 2018. Several comments expressed concern that the USPSTF did not issue a separate positive recommendation for persons at higher risk of developing PAD. This population would include older adults and patients with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and current tobacco use. The USPSTF found the evidence addressing screening for PAD in high-risk, asymptomatic populations to be limited, with no compelling evidence to support differential screening or treatment in subpopulations at greater risk. In addition, patients in higher-risk groups (such as persons with diabetes and older adults) would likely already be candidates for interventions based on their global CVD risk, raising concern about the clinical significance of screening for additional risk factors (ie, asymptomatic PAD). The USPSTF added language to the &ldquo;Accuracy of Screening Tests&rdquo; and &ldquo;Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment&rdquo; sections to clarify this point.</p>\r\n<p>Comments also raised concern that an I statement could have a negative effect on health care disparities for PAD. These comments cited evidence that the prevalence of PAD is disproportionately higher among racial/ethnic minorities and low-socioeconomic populations, and noted that the I statement could discourage testing and perpetuate disparities in treatment and outcomes. The USPSTF recognizes these well-established disparities in care. However, the evidence on screening and treatment in these groups is currently lacking, and the USPSTF was unable to determine the overall balance of benefits and harms. Future research should include diverse populations and report on their outcomes. The USPSTF added language to the &ldquo;Research Needs and Gaps&rdquo; section to clarify this point.</p>",

Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, increasing risk of stroke by as much as 5-fold. Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with atrial fibrillation are first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the time of stroke or shortly thereafter.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether screening with ECG identifies adults 65 years and older with previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation more effectively than usual care.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence directly assessing the benefit of screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG on clinical outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment with anticoagulant therapy reduces the incidence of stroke in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation.

      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to older adults (65 years and older) without symptoms of atrial fibrillation.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>\r\n<p>Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia, affecting more than 2.7 million individuals in the United States.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Atrial fibrillation is strongly associated with older age (eg, prevalence increases from 0.2% among adults &lt;55 years to 10% among those &ge;85 years) and obesity, both of which are increasing in the United States.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Other risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure, prior cardiothoracic surgery, current smoking, prior stroke, sleep apnea, alcohol and drug use, and hyperthyroidism.</p>\r\n<p>Electrocardiography, the intervention considered for this recommendation, records the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes (or leads) placed on the skin. It can be measured with 12 leads, fewer than 12 leads, or a single handheld lead. One systematic review reported a 93% sensitivity and 97% specificity for 12-lead ECG; individual studies in the review reported sensitivity ranging from 68% to 100% and specificity ranging from 76% to 100%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition, several medical devices (eg, automatic blood pressure cuffs and pulse oximeters) are being designed to detect an irregular heartbeat, and an increasing number of consumer devices (eg, wearable monitors and smartphones) have the capability to assess heart rhythm.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Pulse palpation and heart auscultation can also detect atrial fibrillation. In the systematic review discussed above, pulse palpation was reported to have relatively good sensitivity (point estimate, 0.87-1.00) but lower specificity than ECG (point estimate, 0.77-0.84) for detecting atrial fibrillation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;However, to address this lower specificity, confirmatory ECG can be readily performed in practice in response to an irregular pulse.</p>\r\n<p>Without treatment with anticoagulant therapy, patients with atrial fibrillation have an approximately 5-fold increased risk of stroke, and strokes associated with atrial fibrillation tend to be more severe than strokes attributed to other causes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Approximately one-third of patients with atrial fibrillation who have a stroke die within the year, and up to 30% of survivors have some type of permanent disability.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Atrial fibrillation does not always cause noticeable symptoms, and some persons may not be aware that they have it. For approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with atrial fibrillation, stroke is the first sign that they have the condition.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;If persons with undiagnosed atrial fibrillation could be detected earlier and start preventive therapy earlier, some of these strokes might be avoided.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>\r\n<p>The performance of ECG itself is not associated with significant harm, although abnormal results may cause anxiety. Misinterpretation of ECG results may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Treatment of atrial fibrillation includes anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention, which is associated with a risk of bleeding, and pharmacologic, surgical, endovascular (eg, ablation), or combined treatments to control heart rhythm or heart rate. In addition, ECG may detect other abnormalities (either true- or false-positive results) that can lead to invasive confirmatory testing and treatments that have the potential for serious harm. For example, angiography and revascularization are associated with risks, including bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, and allergic reactions to the contrast agent.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n<p>Few data are available on the current prevalence of screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG or the frequency with which pulse palpation or heart auscultation are performed in the United States.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of atrial fibrillation has 2 components&mdash;managing arrhythmia and preventing stroke. In general, these treatment goals are independent of each other, because even restoring sinus rhythm does not necessarily reduce stroke risk enough to change how anticoagulant therapy is managed, given the potential for subsequent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Arrhythmia can be managed by controlling the heart rate to minimize symptoms (usually through medication) or by restoring a normal rhythm. Methods for restoring normal rhythm include electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and surgical or catheter ablation. Some evidence suggests that selected patients may be able to reverse atrial fibrillation through lifestyle changes that address the underlying causes of atrial fibrillation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;Stroke risk for persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation can be estimated with tools such as CHADS<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(congestive heart failure, hypertension, age &ge;75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [doubled]) (developed by Gage and colleagues, Washington University School of Medicine) or its updated version, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age &ge;75 years [doubled], diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque], age 65-74 years, sex category [female]) (Lip and colleagues, University of Birmingham Centre for Cardiovascular Sciences). These tools use somewhat different combinations of patient characteristics and presence or absence of comorbid conditions, as outlined above, to estimate annual risk of stroke and guide decisions about anticoagulation therapy. For patients with atrial fibrillation and high stroke risk (defined as a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of &ge;2), this risk can be reduced with anticoagulant therapy&mdash;either vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) or, more recently, non&ndash;vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.

      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>The connection between atrial fibrillation and stroke is well established, as is the existence of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, especially among older adults. Randomized trials enrolling asymptomatic persons that directly compare screening with usual care and that assess both health outcomes and harms are needed to understand the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibrillation. Other research needs include understanding how to best optimize the accuracy of ECG interpretation. Although the evidence review for this recommendation statement focused on screening with ECG, the effectiveness of newer technologies capable of assessing pulse and heart rhythm as potential screening strategies should be evaluated. In addition, as ECG and other technologies (eg, AliveCOR Kardia system [AliveCor Inc], discussed in the context of the REHEARSE-AF trial below) are used to record heart activity for longer periods and thus are able to detect shorter episodes of arrhythmia, understanding the stroke risk associated with brief episodes of subclinical atrial fibrillation, and the potential benefit of anticoagulation therapy if risk is significant, is another important research need.</p>\r\n<p>Several ongoing trials may help to fill these evidence gaps. The STROKESTOP study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier&nbsp;<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01593553\">NCT01593553</a><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer\">This link goes offsite.

The first study randomized 3001 patients (mean age, 75 years) to prompted pulse palpation (clinicians and nurses were encouraged to record the patient&rsquo;s pulse and follow up an irregular pulse with 12-lead ECG; this strategy was termed \"opportunistic screening\" in this study and in the SAFE study, below) or systematic screening (invitation to attend nurse-led screening with pulse palpation and single-lead ECG).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;The study found no statistically significant difference between systematic screening with ECG and prompted pulse palpation (risk difference, 0.003 [95% CI, &minus;0.002 to 0.009]), although there were few cases of atrial fibrillation and the confidence interval was wide.</p>\r\n<p>The second study (Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly [SAFE]) randomized 50 primary care practices (N&#8197;=&#8197;14,802; mean age, 75 years) to usual care or intervention; patients in the intervention practices were randomized to prompted pulse palpation (clinicians and nurses were encouraged to check the patient&rsquo;s pulse and follow up an irregular pulse with 12-lead ECG) or systematic screening with ECG (invitation to attend nurse-led screening with pulse palpation and 12-lead ECG).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation20\">20-24</a></sup>&nbsp;The SAFE study found that both prompted pulse palpation and systematic screening increased detection of atrial fibrillation by 0.6% over baseline prevalence but found no difference between prompted pulse palpation and systematic screening in the detection of new cases.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;The study reported that 29% of cases detected with prompted pulse palpation and 43% of cases detected with systematic screening had a CHADS<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;score of 2 or greater and thus would be eligible for anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation21\">21</a></sup>&nbsp;The SAFE study also reported subgroup analyses by age and sex. Age had no effect on detection rates; however, while both prompted pulse palpation and systematic screening significantly increased the odds of detecting atrial fibrillation among men (odds ratio, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.30-4.15] and odds ratio, 2.68 [95% CI, 1.52-4.73], respectively), neither screening approach improved detection rates among women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation7\">7</a></sup><a name=\"ReturnHere\"></a></p>\r\n<p>The SAFE study also assessed the accuracy of diagnosis by comparing ECG interpretation at primary care clinics with a reference standard consisting of 2 cardiologists assigned to interpret the same results (with a third cardiologist as arbitrator of any disagreements). The primary care clinics, which had general practitioners reading 12-lead ECG results, had relatively low sensitivity (79.8% [95% CI, 70.5-87.2]) and specificity (91.6% [95% CI, 90.1-93.1]); sinus rhythm was misinterpreted as atrial fibrillation in 114 of 1355 cases.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;Adding a computer algorithm improved the sensitivity of primary care clinic readings from 80% to 92% but did not affect specificity.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation22\">22</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The third study, Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation (REHEARSE-AF), randomized 1001 participants (mean age, 73 years) with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2 or greater to systematic, twice-weekly ECG screening using a single handheld lead for 30 seconds (plus additional recordings if symptoms occurred) over 12 months vs no screening.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;It was not clear if the study excluded persons with symptoms suggestive of atrial fibrillation at baseline. The study found that more new cases of atrial fibrillation were detected in the screening group than in the no screening group (19 vs 5 cases; hazard ratio, 3.9 [95% CI 1.4-10.4]). All new diagnoses of atrial fibrillation were confirmed by a study cardiologist.</p>\r\n<p>Eight of the 19 diagnoses of atrial fibrillation in the screening group were among asymptomatic persons, while 11 diagnoses in the screening group and all 5 diagnoses in the control group were among persons who noted symptoms (palpitations or &ldquo;other symptoms&rdquo;). Most cases (12/19) detected in the screening group were paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; no cases of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were diagnosed in the control group.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 1 randomized clinical trial that reported clinical outcomes from a screening program to detect atrial fibrillation using ECG. In the REHEARSE-AF study, there was a similar number of strokes or transient ischemic attacks in the ECG screening and control groups (6 vs 10 cases;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&#8197;=&#8197;0.34); however, this study was not powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation25\">25</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Four cohort studies suggested that persons with asymptomatic atrial fibrillation have an increased stroke risk similar to that of persons with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, although the risk of selection bias, ascertainment bias (for determining symptom status), and confounding were high.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;Six RCTs and 7 systematic reviews (&gt;100,000 persons with atrial fibrillation) concluded that anticoagulant therapy reduces all-cause mortality by about one-third and ischemic stroke by about two-thirds over 2 years among persons with atrial fibrillation and high stroke risk (usually determined by CHADS<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;or CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score). However, most participants in these trials had established persistent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and the prevalence of symptoms was generally not reported.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation7\">7</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Only 1 included study directly examined the harms of screening. The SAFE study reported anxiety, but only for the intervention group, thus precluding comparative assessment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;One potential source of harms from screening with ECG is additional testing that leads to harms (eg, complications from unnecessary stress testing or angiography performed on the basis of false-positive results suggesting ischemic heart disease). Based on large population-based registries that include symptomatic persons, angiography is associated with a serious harm rate of 1.7%, including arrhythmia (0.40%), death (0.10%), stroke (0.07%), and myocardial infarction (0.05%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation26\">26</a></sup>&nbsp;Treatment with anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention also increases the risk of serious bleeding.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Most older adults with previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation have a stroke risk above the threshold for anticoagulant therapy and would be eligible for treatment. Anticoagulant therapy is effective for stroke prevention in symptomatic persons with atrial fibrillation. However, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether screening with ECG and subsequent treatment in asymptomatic adults is more effective than usual care. At the same time, the harms of diagnostic follow-up and treatment prompted by abnormal ECG results are well established. Given these uncertainties, it is not possible to determine the net benefit of screening with ECG.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 19, 2017, to January 22, 2018. In response to comments, the USPSTF clarified the intervention (screening with ECG) and comparison groups (usual care, including prompted pulse palpation) considered for this recommendation. The USPSTF also added the REHEARSE-AF study to the &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo; section and added the need to understand the stroke risk associated with brief episodes of atrial fibrillation to the &ldquo;Research Needs and Gaps&rdquo; section. In response to requests that the USPSTF not exclude studies of persons with heart failure or with implantable cardiac devices, the USPSTF notes that it is charged with evaluating the benefits and harms of screening and clinical preventive services in generally healthy, asymptomatic persons. Last, the USPSTF added the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology to the &ldquo;Recommendations of Others&rdquo; section.</p>",

      "clinical": "<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation statement applies to all asymptomatic individuals with a cervix, regardless of their sexual history. This recommendation statement does not apply to women who have been diagnosed with a high-grade precancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer, women with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or women who have a compromised immune system (eg, women living with HIV).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>\r\n<p>High-risk HPV infection is associated with nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and women are exposed to hrHPV through sexual intercourse. Although a large proportion of HPV infections resolve spontaneously, the high likelihood of exposure to hrHPV means that women are at risk for precancerous lesions and cervical cancer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Certain risk factors increase risk for cervical cancer, including HIV infection, a compromised immune system, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, and previous treatment of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer. Women with these risk factors are not included in this recommendation and should receive individualized follow-up. Women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer are not at risk for cervical cancer and should not be screened. As part of the clinical evaluation, clinicians should confirm through review of surgical records or direct examination that the cervix was removed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>\r\n<p>Current evidence indicates that there are no clinically important differences between liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology. A variety of platforms are used to detect hrHPV; most use either signal or nucleic acid amplification methods. Published trials of hrHPV testing used in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and hybrid capture technology to test for HPV strains associated with cervical cancer. hrHPV testing has been used for primary screening, cotesting with cytology, and follow-up testing of positive cytology results (reflex hrHPV).2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Screening with cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, and both in combination offer a reasonable balance between benefits and harms for women aged 30 to 65 years; women in this age group should discuss with their health care professional which testing strategy is best for them. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and decision modeling studies suggest that screening with cytology alone is slightly less sensitive for detecting CIN 2 and CIN 3 than screening with hrHPV testing alone. Although screening with hrHPV testing alone or in combination with cytology detects more cases of CIN 2 and CIN 3, this method results in more diagnostic colposcopies for each case detected.2-5</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are a number of different protocols for triage of abnormal results from screening with cytology, hrHPV testing, or cotesting. Clinical trial evidence and modeling suggest that different triage protocols have generally similar detection rates for CIN 2 and CIN 3; however, proceeding directly to diagnostic colposcopy without additional triage leads to a much greater number of colposcopies compared with using other triage protocols. Maintaining comparable benefits and harms of screening with cytology alone or hrHPV testing alone requires that patients, clinicians, and health care organizations adhere to currently recommended protocols for repeat testing, diagnostic colposcopy, and treatment.6, 7</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Timing of Screening</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Women Younger Than 21 Years</strong></p>\r\n<p>Cervical cancer is rare before age 21 years.8 Exposure of cervical cells to hrHPV during vaginal intercourse may lead to cervical carcinogenesis, but the process has multiple steps, involves regression, and is generally not rapid. Because of the slow progression of disease and the high likelihood of regression in this age group, evidence suggests that screening earlier than age 21 years, regardless of sexual history, would lead to more harm than benefit. Treatment of CIN 2 or CIN 3 among women younger than 21 years may increase risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.2, 8</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women Older Than 65 Years</strong></p>\r\n<p>Joint guidelines from the American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology (ACS/ASCCP/ASCP) define adequate prior screening as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotesting results within 10 years before stopping screening, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years.6 The guidelines further state that routine screening should continue for at least 20 years after spontaneous regression or appropriate management of a precancerous lesion, even if this extends screening past age 65 years. Once screening has stopped, it should not resume in women older than 65 years, even if they report having a new sexual partner.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women Older Than 65 Years Who Have Not Been Adequately Screened</strong></p>\r\n<p>Screening may be clinically indicated in older women with an inadequate or unknown screening history. Recent data suggest that one-fourth of women aged 45 to 64 years have not been screened for cervical cancer in the preceding 3 years.9 In particular, women with limited access to care, women from racial/ethnic minority groups, and women from countries where screening is not available may be less likely to meet criteria for adequate prior screening. Certain considerations may also support screening in women older than 65 years who are otherwise at high risk (ie, women with a history of high-grade precancerous lesions or cervical cancer, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or a compromised immune system).2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screening Interval</strong></p>\r\n<p>Screening more frequently than every 3 years with cytology alone confers little additional benefit, with a large increase in harms, including additional procedures and assessment and treatment of transient lesions. Treatment of lesions that would otherwise resolve on their own is harmful because it can lead to procedures with unwanted adverse effects, including the potential for cervical incompetence and preterm labor during pregnancy. Evidence from RCTs, observational studies, and modeling studies suggest that a 5-year screening interval for primary hrHPV testing alone or cotesting offers the best balance of benefits and harms. Screening more frequently than every 5 years with primary hrHPV testing alone or cotesting does not substantially improve benefit but significantly increases the number of screening tests and colposcopies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>Screening aims to identify high-grade precancerous cervical lesions to prevent progression to cervical cancer. High-grade cervical lesions may be treated with excisional and ablative therapies. Early-stage cervical cancer may be treated with surgery (hysterectomy) or chemotherapy. Treatment of precancerous lesions is less invasive than treatment of cancer.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Race/Ethnicity, Geography, and Cervical Cancer</strong></p>\r\n<p>The incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer remain relatively high among certain populations. The overall mortality rate from cervical cancer among African American women is 10.1 deaths per 100,000 women,10 which is more than twice the rate among white women (when adjusted for hysterectomy rate), although the gap has narrowed over time. Mortality is higher among older African American women. Several studies have found that African American women are screened for cervical cancer at rates similar to those for white women and that inadequate follow-up after screening and differences in treatment may be important contributing factors. The higher mortality rate in African American women may also be attributable, in part, to the higher than average rate of adenocarcinoma, which carries a worse prognosis than the most common type of cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma).10-12</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>American Indian/Alaska Native women also have higher rates of cervical cancer mortality (3.2 deaths per 100,000 women) than the US average.10 Factors driving this higher rate may include lower screening rates (16.5% of American Indian/Alaska Native women in the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System reported not receiving a Papanicolaou [Pap] test in the past 5 years)13 and inadequate follow-up.2 Hispanic women have a significantly higher incidence rate of cervical cancer and slightly higher mortality rate (2.6 deaths per 100,000 women [unadjusted for hysterectomy rate]), with especially high rates occurring along the Texas-Mexico border. Although white women overall have the lowest mortality rate from cervical cancer, white women living in geographically isolated and medically underserved areas (particularly Appalachia) have much higher mortality rates than the US average. Asian women also have lower screening rates, especially those who have recently immigrated to the United States and may have language or cultural barriers to screening.10</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to race/ethnicity and geography, insurance coverage plays an important role in access to cervical cancer screening; 23.1% of women without health insurance and 25.5% of women with no regular health care clinician reported not receiving a Pap test in the past 5 years, compared with 11.4% of the general population. Insurance status may interact with other demographic factors, such as race/ethnicity and age, to increase disparities.13 In addition, there are no screening data for women with disabilities and those who identify as lesbian or transgender.14-16</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Progress in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality has been uneven. The most important factors contributing to higher incidence and mortality rates include financial, geographic, and language or cultural barriers to screening; barriers to follow-up; unequal treatment; and difference in cancer types, all of which vary across subpopulations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s Advisory Council on Immunization Practice recommends routine HPV vaccination. A 2-dose schedule is recommended for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 to 14 years. Three doses are recommended for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 to 26 years and for those who have a compromised immune system.17 The overall effect of HPV vaccination on high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer is not yet known. Current trials have not yet provided data on long-term efficacy; therefore, the possibility that vaccination might reduce the need for screening with cytology or hrHPV testing is not established. Given these uncertainties, women who have been vaccinated should continue to be screened as recommended until further evidence accrues.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>\r\n<p>The 2012 ACS/ASCCP/ASCP guidelines6 and 2015 interim guidance from the ASCCP and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO)7 provide algorithms for follow-up of abnormal screening results.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued recommendations on screening for and management of cervical cancer in patients living with HIV.18</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The National Cancer Institute provides strategies for reducing cervical cancer mortality in its report &ldquo;Excess Cervical Cancer Mortality: A Marker for Low Access to Health Care in Poor Communities.&rdquo;19</p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Participation in regular screening has a far greater effect on cervical cancer morbidity and mortality than which of the 3 recommended screening strategies is chosen for women ages 30 to 65 years. Implementation should therefore focus on ensuring that women receive adequate screening, regardless of which strategy is used.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although low screening rates contribute to high mortality rates in certain underserved populations, screening alone is not sufficient to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality and related disparities. Loss to follow-up and disparities in treatment are also contributing factors. Therefore, having systems in place to ensure follow-up of abnormal results, appropriate treatment of any pathology, and support to retain patients throughout the entirety of cancer treatment are important.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></p>\r\n<p>Regular screening for prevention of cervical cancer is highly effective, whether it is with cervical cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, or both in combination. To further reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer, it is necessary to find effective strategies to reach inadequately screened and unscreened women and to address follow-up and treatment issues.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Research is needed to evaluate whether different screening strategies could play a part in reducing mortality rates, as well as ways to improve follow-up for current screening strategies and to ensure equitable access to treatment across populations. In addition, research is needed to determine whether screening after age 65 years has a different balance of benefits and harms in different subpopulations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unlike cytology, samples for hrHPV testing have the potential to be collected by the patient and mailed to health programs for analysis, meaning self-collection may be one strategy for increasing screening rates among populations where they are currently low. Rigorous comparative studies are needed to verify this hypothesis and to identify effective strategies for implementation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another important area for future research is the effect of HPV vaccination, because an increasing number of women and men of screening age are being vaccinated. Decreases in hrHPV type prevalence due to vaccination could reduce the positive predictive value of hrHPV testing, which, along with potential reductions in cancer incidence, may increase the number of false-positive results and, therefore, the balance of benefits and harms. In either case, screening strategies may need to be adjusted.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation. The major change in the current recommendation is that the USPSTF now recommends screening every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone as an alternative to screening every 3 years with cytology alone among women aged 30 to 65 years. These are the 2 preferred screening strategies based on the USPSTF review of trial, cohort, and modeling results. Cotesting as an alternative strategy has demonstrated similar effectiveness, although it may result in more tests and procedures compared with either cytology or hrHPV testing alone. As in the 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF continues to recommend against screening in women younger than 21 years, in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer, and in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>The ACS/ASCCP/ASCP recommend that women aged 21 to 29 years be screened every 3 years with cytology alone (cervical cytology or Pap testing). Women aged 30 to 65 years should be screened every 5 years with cytology and HPV testing (cotesting) or every 3 years with cytology alone. Women at increased risk of cervical cancer (ie, women with a history of cervical cancer, a compromised immune system, or diethylstilbestrol exposure) may need to be screened more often. Women who have had CIN 2+ should continue screening for 20 years after the last abnormal test result, even if it extends screening beyond age 65 years.6 The ASCCP and SGO issued interim guidance in 2015 that recommended primary HPV screening starting at age 25 years as an alternative to cytology alone or cotesting.7 The American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines are in agreement with the USPSTF.65 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated in 2016 that cytology alone and cotesting are still specifically recommended in current guidelines from most major societies; however, primary HPV screening in women 25 years or older can be considered as an alternative to current cytology-based screening if performed per ASCCP and SGO interim guidance.66 The Panel on Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents has issued guidance on screening for and management of HPV in patients living with HIV.18</p>",
      "discussion": "<p><strong>Burden of Diseas</strong>e</p>\r\n<p>Cervical cancer incidence and mortality have decreased significantly since the 1960s because of widespread screening.2 In 2018, an estimated 13,240 new cases and 4,170 deaths will occur, making cervical cancer the 18th most common cause of cancer death in the United States.20 Most cases of cervical cancer and related deaths occur among women who have not been adequately screened, followed up, or treated.2 In 2013, 81.7% of women aged 21 to 44 years and 79.2% of women aged 45 to 64 years reported receiving a Pap test in the past 3 years, as recommended.9 While this is a much higher coverage rate than that of many other cancer screening programs, it still falls short of the Healthy People 2020 goal of screening 93% of women aged 21 to 65 years.21 Further, the burden of cervical cancer incidence and mortality falls disproportionately on racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minority groups, persons with disabilities, and low-income and geographically defined populations.10</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Scope of Review</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence2, 4 on screening for cervical cancer to update its 2012 recommendation.22 The review focused on outcomes from trials and cohort studies in high-resource countries that evaluated screening with hrHPV testing alone or hrHPV and cytology together (cotesting) compared with cervical cytology alone. The review did not examine data on test accuracy or the effectiveness of cytology for screening for cervical cancer, as both were established in the previous evidence review.23 Similarly, the review did not systematically examine data for women younger than 21 years or for women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix except to confirm that the evidence has not changed since the previous review.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the systematic evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned a decision analysis model3, 5 to evaluate the age at which to begin and end screening, the optimal interval for screening, the effectiveness of different screening strategies, and how these factors affect the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies. The USPSTF approach to the use of model-based analysis as a complement to systematic evidence reviews is described in detail elsewhere.24</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Accuracy of Screening Tests</strong></p>\r\n<p>Evidence from RCTs indicates that hrHPV testing and cotesting can detect more cases of CIN 3, but they also have higher false-positive rates compared with cytology alone. Cotesting has the highest false-positive rate. False-positive rates are also higher among women younger than 30 years than among older women because of the higher incidence of transient HPV infection in younger women, even though cervical cancer incidence is lower in this age group.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Estimates of sensitivity and specificity of any screening strategy are heavily influenced by the follow-up of abnormal results, and follow-up protocols in cervical cancer screening trials varied widely.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Effectiveness of Different Screening Strategies</strong></p>\r\n<p>The reduction of mortality and morbidity associated with the introduction of cytology-based screening is consistent across populations. A cluster RCT conducted in India found a nearly 50% reduction in cervical cancer mortality after a single round of hrHPV testing compared with a nonscreened control group after 8 years of follow-up.25 The evidence review did not address whether screening for cervical cancer is effective but rather which screening strategies are most effective, when to start screening, and when to stop screening.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women Younger Than 21 Years</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered the following types of evidence to determine when screening for cervical cancer should begin: cervical cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality among young women; the natural history of precancerous lesions and HPV infection; and the effects of screening in populations of young women. Cervical cancer is rare among women younger than 20 years; according to US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, 0.1% of all incident cancer cases occur in this age group.1 Precancerous lesions are also uncommon. Estimated prevalence of CIN 3 among women younger than 20 years is 0.2%, with a concurrent false-positive cytology rate of about 3.1%.26 In addition, the decision analysis model commissioned for the 2012 USPSTF recommendation showed no net benefit to starting screening before age 21 years.27 The USPSTF did not look at evidence for women younger than 21 years living with HIV or who are otherwise at higher risk of cervical cancer, as they are outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women Aged 21 to 29 Years</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years. Given the high prevalence of transient HPV infection among adolescents and young adults, initial screening at age 21 years should be with cytology alone. The question of what age at which screening with hrHPV testing alone offers comparable benefit has not been directly studied. The 4 trials that compared screening with hrHPV testing alone vs cytology alone found a consistently higher detection rate among younger women (younger than 30 or 35 years), which raises concern for overdiagnosis and overtreatment of transient infection.28-31 Modeling estimates of the effects of switching from screening with cytology alone to hrHPV testing alone at ages 25, 27, and 30 years found minimal differences in terms of life-years gained compared with switching screening strategies at age 30 vs 25 years (64,193 vs 64,195 life-years gained per 1000 women screened, respectively). However, screening with hrHPV testing alone starting at age 25 years rather than age 30 years increased the number of colposcopies by nearly 400 colposcopies per 1000 women screened.3 Therefore, switching from cytology alone to hrHPV testing alone at age 30 years appears to offer similar benefits in terms of cancer reduction as switching at younger ages but with fewer associated tests and procedures.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women Aged 30 to 65 Years</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 8 trials of cervical cancer screening; 4 RCTs compared screening with hrHPV testing alone vs cytology alone and 4 RCTs compared screening with cytology alone vs cotesting (cytology in combination with hrHPV testing).2 No trials directly compared screening strategies using hrHPV testing alone vs cotesting. Meta-analysis was not possible because the trials varied substantially in terms of cytology type (conventional vs liquid-based), hrHPV test (polymerase chain reaction vs hybrid capture), screening interval (2 to 5 years), follow-up protocols for abnormal results, and protocols for screening beyond the first round. No trial included more than 2 rounds of screening. Although the purpose of screening is to reduce cervical cancer mortality, the mortality rate is so low in countries that have organized cytology screening programs that it is impractical to directly measure the effects of different screening strategies on mortality through clinical trials. Therefore, trials measured the rate of CIN 3+ (CIN 3 or worse) detection, and some trials also reported the rate of invasive cervical cancer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>hrHPV Testing Alone vs Conventional Cytology Alone</strong></p>\r\n<p>Four RCTs (N &gt; 250,000 women) compared screening with hrHPV testing alone vs cytology alone: the New Technologies for Cervical Cancer (NTCC) Phase II trial in Italy,28, 32-34 the HPV for Cervical Cancer Screening (HPV FOCAL) trial in Canada,29 the FINNISH trial in Finland,30 and the Compass trial in Australia.31 Overall, the 4 trials found that hrHPV testing alone led to an increase in the rate of CIN 3+ detection compared with cytology alone in the first round of screening. The NTCC Phase II and HPV FOCAL trials enrolled women aged 25 to 60 or 65 years and had 2 rounds of screening 2 to 4 years apart. The FINNISH trial, which enrolled women aged 25 to 65 years, had a single round of screening and then followed up participants for 5 years through a cancer registry. The Compass trial, which enrolled 4995 women aged 25 to 64 years, randomized participants to liquid-based cytology every 2.5 years or hrHPV primary screening every 5 years.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The NTCC Phase II trial found that hrHPV testing alone had a cumulative CIN 3+ detection rate twice that of cytology alone (0.4% vs 0.2%). The FINNISH trial measured the rate of invasive cervical cancer detection at 5 years; screening with hrHPV testing alone had a detection rate of 0.03% and screening with cytology alone had a detection rate of 0.01%. Recently published results from the HPV FOCAL trial35 found that hrHPV testing alone had a higher detection rate for CIN 3+ (0.7%) compared with cytology (0.4%) after 4 years of follow-up. The Compass trial reported preliminary results consistent with those from the other 3 trials, but final results at 5 years of follow-up have not yet been published.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The primary harms measured in the RCTs were the total number of follow-up tests, number of colposcopies, and false-positive rates. Although follow-up tests and colposcopies are essential to detection of cancer, they represent a burden and risk to patients and are a proxy measure for downstream harms; therefore, screening strategies that minimize the number of tests and colposcopies per each cancer case averted are desirable. Colposcopy rates were higher for hrHPV testing alone than for cytology alone in 1 of 3 trials (NTCC Phase II) and similar in 2 trials (FINNISH and HPV FOCAL). False-positive rates for CIN 2+ were higher for hrHPV testing alone than for cytology alone in 1 trial (NTCC Phase II) and similar in another trial (FINNISH).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cotesting vs Cytology Alone</strong></p>\r\n<p>Four RCTs (N &gt; 130,000 women) compared screening with cytology alone vs cotesting (cytology in combination with hrHPV testing): the NTCC Phase I trial in Italy,28, 32, 34 Swedescreen in Sweden,36, 37 A Randomized Trial in Screening to Improve Cytology (ARTISTIC) in the United Kingdom,38-40 and the Population-Based Screening Study Amsterdam (POBASCAM) in the Netherlands.41 In all 4 trials, the cumulative relative ratio of CIN 3+ detection between the 2 strategies (cotesting vs cytology alone) were not statistically significant after 2 rounds of screening. The trials varied considerably in starting age (20 to 29 years), stopping age (38 to 64 years), and follow-up protocols. The NTCC Phase I, ARTISTIC, and POBASCAM trials reported 2 rounds of screening at 3- to 5-year intervals, whereas Swedescreen reported 1 round of screening with registry follow-up at 3 years. Two trials (Swedescreen and POBASCAM) reported no difference between screening strategies at 13 to 14 years of follow-up.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These 4 trials reported hrHPV positive rates of 7% to 22% for screening with cotesting; again, rates were highest among women younger than 30 or 35 years. Colposcopy rates were higher for screening with cotesting than for cytology alone in 2 trials (ARTISTIC and NTCC Phase I) and not reported in the other 2 trials (Swedescreen and POBASCAM). False-positive rates were higher for screening with cotesting in 3 of 4 trials (Swedescreen did not report the false-positive rate for the intervention group).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The ARTISTIC trial also surveyed a subsample of patients (N = 2508) about the psychological effects of screening.42 It found no difference in distress or anxiety between women screened with cotesting and women screened with cytology alone. Women in the cotesting group who were notified of positive HPV results reported lower sexual satisfaction regardless of their cytology results, but there were no statistically significant differences in psychological distress or anxiety between study groups.38 A separate cross-sectional study used a survey to evaluate the psychological effects of screening with hrHPV cotesting in women aged 20 to 64 years (N = 428) and found that women who received a positive HPV result were more distressed and had more negative feelings about their sexual partners than women who received a negative HPV result.43</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Evidence From Observational Studies</strong></p>\r\n<p>In addition to RCTs, the USPSTF also reviewed evidence from an individual participant data meta-analysis that pooled patients from 4 trials (NTCC Phase I, Swedescreen, ARTISTIC, and POBASCAM), as well as a single trial of primary hrHPV testing (NTCC Phase II). The meta-analysis found a 40% lower incidence of invasive cervical cancer among patients screened with some form of hrHPV testing compared with cytology alone.44 Biopsy rates from the individual participant data meta-analysis suggest that these higher colposcopy rates led to higher rates of biopsy with cotesting than with cytology alone. However, since the meta-analysis pooled data from trials with distinctly different screening strategies and hrHPV test types, these findings cannot be interpreted with certainty.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The trial evidence was also supplemented with results from 4 cohort studies. One study considered primary hrHPV screening,45 2 studies considered cotesting,46-51 and 1 reported on cotesting among underscreened women.52 These outcomes were not notably different from the trial outcomes. A recently published report on women (N = 1,262,713) screened 1 or more times in Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2003 and 2015, which included women aged 25 to 29 years screened with cytology and triage with hrHPV testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and women aged 30 to 77 years screened with cotesting, also suggests that women who test negative for hrHPV have very low rates of subsequent CIN 3+, regardless of cytology results.53 It is important to note that women younger than 30 or 35 years had higher hrHPV-positive and CIN 3+ rates, accompanied by higher colposcopy rates.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Data from long-term follow-up studies37, 54 and a large US cohort study55 suggest a minimal risk of missing cervical cancer among women who test negative with cotesting or primary hrHPV screening. An analysis of long-term data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California suggests that women with 1 or more negative results from cotesting have a reduced risk for future cancer.53</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits and Harms of Various Screening Strategies Based on Decision Modeling</strong></p>\r\n<p>The decision model commissioned by the USPSTF reported benefits and harms consistent with the outcomes observed in the trials. Both hrHPV testing alone and cotesting would avert approximately 1 additional cancer case per 1000 women screened compared with cytology alone (17.8 vs 16.5 cases, respectively), representing a very small improvement in life-years gained (64,193 vs 64,182 life-years, respectively).3 However, these 2 screening strategies would also subject women to more tests and procedures. Although no head-to-head trials compared screening with hrHPV testing alone vs cotesting, modeling suggests that both hrHPV testing alone and cotesting offer similar benefit over cytology in terms of cancer cases averted and are also similar in terms of the number of colposcopies required (1630 vs 1635, respectively). In summary, all 3 screening strategies offer substantial benefit in terms of reducing cancer incidence and mortality compared with no screening.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screening Interval Based on Decision Modeling</strong></p>\r\n<p>The decision model conducted for the 2012 USPSTF recommendation found that screening every 3 years with cytology alone starting at age 21 years confers a similar number of life-years gained as annual screening (69,&#8197;247 vs 69,213 life-years gained per 1000 women screened, respectively), yet results in fewer than half the number of colposcopies and fewer false-positive results.27 Screening intervals for hrHPV testing varied across trials from 2 to 5 years, and observational studies of primary hrHPV testing and cotesting examined intervals from 3 to 5 years. For women aged 30 to 65 years, modeling suggests similar life-years gained with 3- and 5-year screening intervals but more tests and procedures with a 3-year screening interval (64,193.19 vs 64,193.07 life-years gained per 1000 women screened every 3 and 5 years, respectively).3 Thus, the USPSTF recommends 5-year screening intervals for hrHPV testing alone or for cotesting based on evidence from RCTs, observational data, and modeling studies (Table).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women Older Than 65 Years</strong></p>\r\n<p>None of the screening trials enrolled women older than 65 years, so direct evidence on when to stop screening is not available. When deliberating on the age at which to stop screening, the USPSTF considered the incidence of cervical cancer in older women and whether the pattern of cervical cancer incidence differs in screened vs unscreened women. The incidence and prevalence of CIN peak in the midreproductive years and begin to decline in approximately the fourth decade of life, a general pattern also apparent among certain previously unscreened women. Cervical cancer in older women is not more aggressive or rapidly progressive than it is in younger women. The rate of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions diagnosed by cytology is low in older women who have had adequate prior screening. The decision model commissioned by the USPSTF also supports the current practice of stopping screening at age 65 years in adequately screened women. The model projected that extending screening beyond age 65 years in women with an adequate screening history would not have significant benefit using any of the considered screening strategies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although screening women older than 65 years who have an adequate screening history is not recommended, data suggest that screening rates begin to decline before that age. As a result, approximately 13% of 65-year-old women have not been adequately screened, and this number increases to 37.1% if the patient has no regular health care provider.13 A Kaiser Permanente registry study found that the majority of cases of invasive cervical cancer among women older than 65 years occurred among those who had not met criteria for stopping screening.55, 62 This suggests that the decision to stop screening at age 65 years should only be made after confirming that the patient has received prior adequate screening. Current guidelines define adequate screening as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative HPV results within 10 years before stopping screening, with the most recent test performed within 5 years.6</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women Who Have Had a Hysterectomy With Removal of the Cervix</strong></p>\r\n<p>Two large studies have documented the low risk for cytology abnormalities after hysterectomy. A cross-sectional study of more than 5000 cytology tests among women older than 50 years found that identification of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer was rare in this age group after hysterectomy.63 In a second study of more than 10,000 Pap tests performed over 2 years in 6265 women who had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix, screening yielded 104 abnormal Pap test results and no cases of cervical cancer; in addition, 6 cases of high-grade vaginal lesions were detected, but it is not known whether detection of these cases improved clinical outcomes.64</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Harms of Screening</strong></p>\r\n<p>Screening with cervical cytology and hrHPV testing can lead to harms, including more frequent follow-up testing and invasive diagnostic procedures (eg, colposcopy and cervical biopsy), as well as unnecessary treatment in women with false-positive results. Evidence from RCTs and observational studies indicate that harms from diagnostic procedures include vaginal bleeding, pain, infection, and failure to diagnose (due to inadequate sampling). Abnormal screening test results are also associated with psychological harms. In particular, women who received positive hrHPV results reported greater distress and lower satisfaction with past and current sexual partners than women who received abnormal cytology results.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of hrHPV testing alone in women aged 21 to 29 years are moderate. Primary hrHPV testing has been found to result in high rates of positive tests in this age group, in which HPV infections are likely to resolve spontaneously. The high frequency of transient HPV infection among women younger than 30 years can lead to unnecessary follow-up diagnostic and treatment interventions with potential for harm.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer (with cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting with both) in women aged 30 to 65 years are moderate. Screening strategies that include hrHPV testing are slightly more sensitive than those that include cytology alone but also yield more false-positive results. Cotesting is also slightly more sensitive than cytology alone but leads to the highest false-positive rates.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk are at least small. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer in women younger than 21 years are moderate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer is associated with harms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Harms of Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>The harms of treatment include risks from the treatment procedure and the potential subsequent consequences of treatment. Evidence from observational studies indicates that certain treatments for precancerous lesions (eg, cold-knife conization and loop excision) are associated with subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm delivery and related complications.2 The USPSTF found convincing evidence that many precancerous cervical lesions will regress and that other lesions are indolent, slow growing, and will not become clinically important over a woman&rsquo;s lifetime; identification and treatment of these lesions constitute overdiagnosis. Estimating the precise magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with any screening or treatment strategy is difficult, but it is of concern because it confers no benefit and leads to unnecessary surveillance, diagnostic tests, and treatments, with associated harms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is convincing evidence that screening with cervical cytology alone, primary hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting can detect high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening women aged 21 to 65 years substantially reduces cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer (with cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting with both) in women aged 30 to 65 years are moderate. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years substantially outweigh the harms. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with both in combination in women aged 30 to 65 years outweigh the harms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and women younger than 21 years does not provide significant benefit. There is convincing evidence that screening women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer provides no benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer in women younger than 21 years and of screening with hrHPV testing alone in women aged 21 to 29 years are moderate. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk are at least small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer is associated with harms. The USPSTF concludes with moderate to high certainty that screening women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer, screening women younger than 21 years, and screening women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer does not result in a positive net benefit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The natural history of cervical cancer has been well studied. Infection of the cervix with HPV is generally transient, but when the infection is not cleared by an appropriate immune response and the virus is of an oncogenic type, the infection can result in incorporation of HPV gene sequences into the host genome, which can lead to precancerous lesions. The long preclinical phase from infection to development of precancerous lesions and cervical cancer allows for the opportunity to effectively screen for, identify, and treat precancerous lesions, thereby reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></p>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 12, 2017, through October 13, 2017. Many comments pointed to a need for greater clarity in describing differences between cotesting and primary hrHPV testing. Several comments requested clarification on the information presented in the modeling report. Some comments highlighted implementation issues due to a lack of tests approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for primary cervical cancer screening. In response to these comments, the USPSTF now notes throughout the recommendation statement that women aged 30 to 65 years may choose to get screened every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with cotesting. Accordingly, the USPSTF provided a table in the Clinical Considerations section that presents detailed information about the available evidence on the effectiveness, strengths, limitations, and unique considerations of each screening method. For further clarification on the modeling study, the USPSTF added the calibrated input parameter values, which should enable informed readers to assess the estimates used. The USPSTF added language throughout the recommendation statement to emphasize the importance of several different factors that affect overall screening effectiveness, including the primary screening test, screening ages, screening interval, test characteristics, and follow-up protocols, including triage of screen-positive women.</p>",

      "rationale": "<p><strong>Importance</strong></p>\r\n<p>Syphilis is an infection that is primarily sexually transmitted. Untreated syphilis infection in pregnant women can also be transmitted to the fetus (congenital syphilis) at any time during pregnancy or at birth. Congenital syphilis is associated with stillbirth, neonatal death, and significant morbidity in infants (eg, bone deformities and neurologic impairment).1 After a steady decline from 2008 to 2012, cases of congenital syphilis markedly increased from 2012 to 2016, from 8.4 to 15.7 cases per 100,000 live births (an increase of 87%).2 At the same time, national rates of syphilis increased among women of reproductive age.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reaffirmation</strong></p>\r\n<p>In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women and issued an A recommendation.3 The USPSTF has decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation. The USPSTF uses the reaffirmation process for well-established, evidence-based standards of practice in current primary care practice for which only a very high level of evidence would justify a change in the grade of the recommendation.4 In its deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF considers whether the new evidence is of sufficient strength and quality to change its previous conclusions about the evidence.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Detection</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening tests can accurately detect syphilis infection in pregnant women.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that early universal screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women reduces the incidence of congenital syphilis and the adverse outcomes of pregnancy associated with maternal infection.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women may result in potential harms, including false-positive results that require clinical evaluation, anxiety, and harms of treatment with antibiotic medications. However, the USPSTF concluded that these harms of screening are no greater than small.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong></p>\r\n<p>Using a reaffirmation process,4 the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women is substantial.</p>",
      "clinical": "<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to all pregnant women.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screening Intervals</strong></p>\r\n<p>All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis as early as possible when they first present to care. If a woman has not received prenatal care prior to delivery, she should be tested at the time she presents for delivery. In most cases of congenital syphilis, pregnant women received prenatal care but were not screened and treated for syphilis early enough during the pregnancy to prevent transmission to the fetus.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new studies that examined the effectiveness of repeated testing for syphilis during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)5 and joint guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)6 endorse repeat screening. Specifically, these groups recommend that women at high risk for syphilis be rescreened early in the third trimester (at approximately 28 weeks of gestation) and again at delivery. Women at high risk for syphilis infection include those living in communities or geographic areas with higher prevalence of syphilis, those living with HIV, and those with a history of incarceration or commercial sex work.7 AAP and ACOG also recommend repeat screening after exposure to an infected partner.6 Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in the communities they serve.7 Most states mandate screening for syphilis in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, and some mandate screening at the time of delivery.8</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>\r\n<p>Syphilis infection is caused by the Treponema pallidum bacteria. Current screening tests for syphilis rely on detection of antibodies to the infection rather than direct detection of the bacteria. Screening for syphilis infection is a 2-step process. Traditionally, screening involved an initial &ldquo;nontreponemal&rdquo; antibody test (ie, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) to detect biomarkers released from damage caused by syphilis infection, followed by a confirmatory &ldquo;treponemal&rdquo; antibody detection test (ie, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption or T pallidum particle agglutination test). Because nontreponemal tests are complex, a reverse sequence screening algorithm has been developed in which an automated treponemal test (such as an enzyme-linked, chemiluminescence, or multiplex flow immunoassay) is performed first, followed by a nontreponemal test. If the test results of the reverse sequence algorithm are discordant, a second treponemal test (preferably using a different treponemal antibody) is performed. The USPSTF found no studies comparing the false-positive rate of the traditional screening algorithm with that of the reverse sequence screening algorithm among pregnant women. The CDC has provided more detailed guidance on testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis.9</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>In 2015, the CDC recommended parenteral benzathine penicillin G for the treatment of syphilis in pregnant women.5 Evidence on the efficacy or safety of alternative antibiotic medications for pregnant women and the fetus is very limited; therefore, women who report a penicillin allergy should be evaluated and, if found allergic, desensitized and treated with penicillin. Because the CDC updates its recommendations regularly, clinicians are encouraged to consult the CDC website for the most up-to-date information.9</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>\r\n<p>Trends in congenital syphilis incidence rates are closely related to trends in primary and secondary syphilis infection rates among all women. Screening for syphilis in nonpregnant populations is an important public health approach to preventing the sexual transmission of syphilis and subsequent vertical transmission of congenital syphilis. The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in nonpregnant adolescents and adults at increased risk for infection.10</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea,11 hepatitis B virus,12 genital herpes,13 and HIV.14 National-, state-, and county-level data on syphilis infection rates are also available from the CDC.2</p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations: Research Needs and Gaps</strong></p>\r\n<p>Although the benefits of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women to prevent congenital syphilis are well established, additional studies on the use of different screening algorithms in pregnant women, as well as studies to help identify optimal rescreening intervals and populations to rescreen during pregnancy, could help inform implementation of screening programs. Studies on treatment options besides penicillin could also be helpful.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reaffirmation of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2009 recommendation statement.3 In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women and found that the benefits of screening substantially outweighed the harms.22 For the current recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a targeted review16 to look for substantial new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and determined that the net benefit of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women continues to be well established. The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and, therefore, reaffirms its recommendation to screen for syphilis infection in all pregnant women.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation statement is consistent with those of other professional and public health organizations. The CDC recommends screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women at their first prenatal visit.5 Joint guidelines from AAP and ACOG recommend screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women as early as possible in pregnancy.6 The CDC, AAP, and ACOG also recommend repeat screening at 28 weeks of gestation and again at delivery in high-risk women. Women at high risk for syphilis infection include those living in high-prevalence communities, those living with HIV, and those with a history of incarceration or commercial sex work.10 AAP and ACOG also recommend repeat screening after exposure to an infected partner.6 The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women.29</p>",
      "discussion": "<p><strong>Burden of Disease</strong></p>\r\n<p>Although national rates of syphilis infection among pregnant women are not currently available, the incidence rates of primary and secondary syphilis infection among women and congenital syphilis among infants have been increasing, despite consistent recommendations and legal mandates to screen for syphilis in pregnant women.2 In 2012, there were 0.9 cases of primary and secondary syphilis infection per 100,000 women and 8.4 cases of congenital syphilis per 100,000 live births. In 2016, the case rate had increased to 1.9 cases of primary and secondary syphilis infection per 100,000 women and 15.7 cases of congenital syphilis per 100,000 live births.15</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Late or limited prenatal care has been associated with congenital syphilis.2 Although nearly 70% of infants with congenital syphilis are born to mothers who received prenatal care, detection and treatment of maternal syphilis often occurs too late to treat the fetus and prevent congenital syphilis.15 Recent data suggest that while screening rates for syphilis infection are generally high, the proportion of women screened earlier in pregnancy remains low (eg, 20% of women are screened only at the time of delivery).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Primary, secondary, and congenital syphilis rates differ by race/ethnicity. Case rates of primary, secondary, and congenital syphilis are higher in black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic populations than in white populations.2 Syphilis rates also differ by geography, with generally higher rates of primary, secondary, and congenital syphilis in the Western and Southern states and lower rates in the Northeastern and Midwest states. However, clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in their community, as rates can vary.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Syphilis can be transmitted to the fetus during all stages of maternal infection, although the risk is highest with primary and secondary maternal syphilis infection, which is why detection early in pregnancy is important.5, 16, 17 Untreated syphilis infection during pregnancy greatly increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. A 2013 systematic review of 6 case-control studies found that compared with pregnancies that did not have maternal syphilis infection, untreated maternal syphilis infection during pregnancy was associated with an absolute difference of 21% for stillbirth or fetal loss, 9% for neonatal death, and 5% for prematurity or low birth weight.18 Although infants born with congenital syphilis are often asymptomatic at birth, some may develop signs within the first several weeks of life, including rash, hemorrhagic rhinitis, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal abnormalities.19 Additional sequelae include anemia, neurologic impairment such as blindness or deafness, and meningitis.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Scope of Review</strong></p>\r\n<p>To reaffirm its 2009 recommendation on screening for syphilis in pregnant women, the USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update. The aim of this update is to identify substantial new evidence that is sufficient enough to change the prior recommendation. Given the established benefits and practice of screening for syphilis in pregnant women, the USPSTF targeted its evidence review to the direct benefits of screening on the prevention of congenital syphilis morbidity and mortality and the harms of screening for and treatment of syphilis infection in pregnant women.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new evidence inconsistent with the benefits of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women. Evidence from observational studies demonstrates fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women screened and treated for syphilis infection compared with pregnant women not treated. In particular, treatment appears to be more beneficial when provided earlier rather than later in pregnancy.16 A 2014 systematic review of 54 observational studies found that incidence of congenital syphilis, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death was dramatically reduced in women treated for syphilis during pregnancy compared with women who had untreated syphilis.20 However, only a slight reduction in stillbirth or fetal loss was observed in women who were only treated in the third trimester, compared with women who had untreated syphilis. Extended follow-up of a study previously considered by the USPSTF for its 2009 recommendation3 reported on the effects of implementing a free syphilis screening and treatment program for all pregnant women living in Shenzhen, China, from 2002 to 2012 (n&#8197;=&#8197;2,441,237).21 During follow-up, screening uptake increased from 89.8% to 97.2%, and the congenital syphilis case rate decreased from 109.3 to 9.4 cases per 100,000 live births. During the same time, the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes decreased from 42.7% to 19.2%, and the incidence of stillbirth or fetal loss decreased from 19.0% to 3.3%. The USPSTF found this evidence to be consistent with findings from its previous evidence review.22</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for and treatment of syphilis infection include false-positive results that require clinical evaluation, unnecessary anxiety to the patient, and harms of antibiotic medication use.16 Consistent with previous reviews, the current, targeted review identified 5 studies that reported on false-positive rates of various screening tests23-27 and 1 study that reported on false-negative RPR test results.28 Overall, these studies demonstrate that false-positive results with chemiluminescence or enzyme-linked immunoassay in pregnant women are common (false-positive rates ranged from 0% to 88.2%)23-27 and that false-negative RPR test results can result from undiluted serum with high titers (known as the prozone effect).28 Because of the high potential for false-positive results with individual tests, a 2-step screening algorithm is recommended. The USPSTF found no studies that reported on the false-positive rate of the traditional or reverse sequence screening algorithm in pregnant women. Harms of treatment include rare adverse drug-related effects, such as anaphylaxis attributable to penicillin allergy and the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (febrile reaction with headache, myalgia, and other symptoms), which may occur within the first 24 hours after any type of syphilis therapy. The USPSTF found no studies that reported on harms to the fetus from treatment of syphilis infection.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered the evidence using a reaffirmation process and found that accurate screening algorithms are available to identify syphilis infection. Effective treatment with antibiotics can prevent congenital syphilis and significantly decrease adverse pregnancy outcomes, with small associated harms, providing an overall substantial health benefit. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women provides substantial net benefit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></p>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 6, 2018, to March 5, 2018. Most comments supported the recommendation statement. Several comments requested clearer guidance about the timing of initial syphilis screening (as early as possible after the first positive pregnancy test result). Other comments requested clarification on risk factors that would warrant repeat testing. The USPSTF provided more information in the recommendation statement to address these concerns. Several comments requested changes that are outside the scope of the USPSTF or not consistent with its methods and processes, and so no changes were made in response. These suggested changes included endorsement of guidelines from other organizations and discussion of evidence not considered in the USPSTF&rsquo;s deliberation on this recommendation. Some comments suggested additional citations; these were reviewed by the USPSTF but none met inclusion criteria.</p>",

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are associated with less weight gain after the cessation of interventions, compared with control groups. The magnitude of these benefits is moderate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (ie, behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity as small to none, based on the absence of reported harms in the evidence and the noninvasive nature of the interventions. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (ie, behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions) has a moderate net benefit.</p>",
      "clinical": "<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to adults 18 years or older. The USPSTF uses the following terms to define categories of increased BMI: &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; is a BMI of 25 to 29.9 and &ldquo;obesity&rdquo; is a BMI of 30 or higher. Obesity can be categorized as class 1 (BMI of 30.0 to 34.9), class 2 (BMI of 35.0 to 39.9), or class 3 (BMI of &ge;40) (see the Table for other USPSTF recommendations related to weight).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many of the effective intensive behavioral interventions considered by the USPSTF were designed to help participants achieve or maintain a 5% or greater weight loss through a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity. The US Food and Drug Administration considers a weight loss of 5% as clinically important.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Most of the intensive behavioral weight loss interventions considered by the USPSTF lasted for 1 to 2 years, and the majority had 12 or more sessions in the first year.1 One-third of the interventions had a &ldquo;core&rdquo; phase (ranging from 3-12 months) followed by a &ldquo;support&rdquo; or &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; phase (ranging from 9-12 months).1 Most behavioral interventions encouraged self-monitoring of weight and provided tools to support weight loss or weight loss maintenance (eg, pedometers, food scales, or exercise videos).1 Similar behavior change techniques and weight loss messages were used across the trials.1 Some trials provided interventions modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention for use in a primary care or community setting.1 Study heterogeneity, trial quality, and differences in populations and settings made it difficult to identify the most effective intervention characteristics (eg, number of sessions, in-person vs remote sessions, or group- vs individual-based).1 Benefits may depend on tailoring interventions to social, environmental, and individual factors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Interventionists varied across the trials, and interventions included varied interactions with a primary care clinician. Primary care clinician involvement ranged from limited interactions with participants in interventions conducted by other practitioners or individuals (ie, group-based interventions conducted by lifestyle coaches or registered dietitians) to reinforcing intervention messages through brief counseling sessions.1 Few interventions included a primary care clinician as the primary interventionist over 3 to 12 months of individual counseling. In the trials not involving a primary care clinician, the interventionists were highly diverse and included behavioral therapists, psychologists, registered dietitians, exercise physiologists, lifestyle coaches, and other staff. The majority of the trials focused on individual participants, but a few interventions invited family members to participate.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Trials used various delivery methods (group, individual, mixed, and technology- or print-based). Group-based interventions ranged from 8 group sessions over 2.5 months to weekly group sessions over 1 year (median, 23 total sessions in the first year). These interventions consisted of classroom-style sessions lasting 1 to 2 hours.1 Within the group-based interventions, some trials offered supplemental support with 1 brief individual counseling session, while other trials provided referral and free access to commercially available group-based weight loss programs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Most of the individual-based interventions provided individual counseling sessions, with or without ongoing telephone support.1 The remaining interventions were provided remotely through telephone counseling calls (average time, 15-30 minutes) and web-based self-monitoring and support. The median number of sessions in the first year for individual-based interventions was 12.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Mixed interventions included comparatively equal numbers of group- and individual-based counseling sessions, with or without other forms of support (eg, telephone-, print-, or web-based). Most of these interventions took place for more than 1 year and involved more than 12 sessions (median, 23 total sessions in the first year).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Among technology-based interventions, intervention components included computer- or web-based intervention modules,1 web-based self-monitoring, mobile phone&ndash;based text messages, smartphone applications, social networking platforms, or DVD learning. Only 1 trial delivered its intervention through print-based tailored materials.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rates of participant adherence were generally high.1 More than two-thirds of study participants completed interventions. In addition, all study participants completed more than two-thirds of the intervention. Participation rates did decline over time.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Behavior-based weight loss maintenance trials were designed to maintain weight loss by continuing dietary changes and physical activity.1 Interventions included group interventions, technology-based individual counseling sessions, or a combination of individual and group counseling. Most weight loss maintenance interventions lasted for 12 to 18 months; the majority of interventions had more than 12 sessions in the first year.1 Intervention components focused on nutrition, physical activity, self-monitoring, identifying barriers, problem solving, peer support, and relapse prevention.1 Participants used tools such as food diaries and pedometers to help maintain weight loss.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Interventions that combined pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions reported greater weight loss and weight loss maintenance over 12 to 18 months compared with behavioral interventions alone.1 However, the participants in the pharmacotherapy trials were required to meet highly selective inclusion criteria, including adherence to taking medications and meeting weight loss goals before enrollment. These trials also had high attrition.1 Therefore, it is unclear how well patients tolerate these medications and whether the findings from these trials are applicable to the general US primary care population. In addition, data were lacking about the maintenance of improvement after discontinuation of pharmacotherapy.1 As a result, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary focus of effective interventions for weight loss in adults.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes,13 screening for high blood pressure,14 statin use in persons at risk for cardiovascular disease,15 counseling for tobacco smoking cessation,16 aspirin use in certain persons for prevention of cardiovascular disease,17 and behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention in adults with and without common risk factors18, 19 (Table). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation).20</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends multicomponent interventions that use technology-supported coaching or counseling to help adults lose weight and maintain weight loss.21</p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>\r\n<p>Research Needs and Gaps</p>\r\n<p>Further research is needed to examine the effects of interventions for obesity on longer-term weight and health outcomes (eg, cardiovascular outcomes), including data on important subpopulations (eg, older adults, racial/ethnic groups, or persons who are overweight). Psychosocial, quality of life, and patient-centered outcomes should continue to be evaluated in future studies. Well-designed pragmatic trials and improved reporting of intervention characteristics to enable evaluation and dissemination of interventions in primary care settings are needed. Future research is needed on factors (eg, genetics or untreated medical or psychological conditions) that may be barriers to weight loss during behavioral interventions. Trials are needed that examine whether interventions that focus on both weight loss and support of persons living with obesity improve patient-centered outcomes. Comparative effectiveness trials would provide more evidence about the components of effective interventions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation updates the 2012 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for obesity in adults (B recommendation).33</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends screening for obesity in adults with BMI at primary care visits.34 The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the Obesity Society recommend screening for obesity in adults with BMI and waist circumference.35, 36 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend screening for obesity with BMI and using waist circumference as a supplement in adults with a BMI higher than 35.37, 38 The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for obesity in all adults and offering or referring patients with a BMI of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.39</p>",
      "discussion": "<p><strong>Burden of Disease</strong></p>\r\n<p>From 2013 to 2014, the prevalence of obesity in the United States was greater than 35% among men and 40% among women.2 One in 13 Americans has a BMI higher than 40 (class 3 obesity).22 According to 2011-2014 data, the age-adjusted prevalence of persons who are overweight or obese is 72.8% among men and 66.2% among women.23</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity varies across race/ethnicity. The age-adjusted prevalence of obesity is higher among non-Hispanic black (57.2%) and Hispanic (46.9%) women than among non-Hispanic white (38.2%) women. Among men, obesity prevalence is 38.0% in non-Hispanic black, 37.9% in Hispanic, and 34.7% in non-Hispanic white men.24 Obesity rates among Asian Americans are lower than among other racial/ethnic groups (12.6% and 12.4% in men and women, respectively). However, Asian Americans have higher body fat at a given BMI than other racial/ethnic groups. When using an adjusted cut point of greater than 25, obesity prevalence is higher among US-born Asian Americans (43%) than among non-Hispanic whites (36%).25</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Scope of Review</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2012 recommendation on screening for obesity in adults.1, 26 Because screening for obesity is now part of routine clinical practice, it was not a focus of this review. The USPSTF reviewed evidence on interventions (behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight loss maintenance that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting. Waist circumference may be an acceptable alternative to BMI measurement in some patient subpopulations. Surgical weight loss interventions and nonsurgical weight loss devices (eg, gastric balloons) are considered to be outside the scope of the primary care setting.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Effectiveness of Behavioral Counseling and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on 4 types of interventions: behavior-based weight loss (80 trials), behavior-based weight loss maintenance (9 trials), pharmacotherapy-based weight loss (32 trials), and pharmacotherapy-based weight loss maintenance (3 trials). In the weight loss maintenance trials, patient randomization occurred after prior weight loss.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 89 behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance trials, 26 of which were good quality and 63 of which were fair quality. Eighty trials focused on behavior-based weight loss interventions.1 The majority of behavior-based weight loss intervention trials (47 trials) were conducted in the United States; other study sites included Europe (15 trials), the United Kingdom (11 trials), Japan (3 trials), Australia (2 trials), and Canada (2 trials). In more than half of the trials (40 trials), participants came from an unselected population of adults who were overweight or had obesity. In the remaining trials, enrolled participants had elevated clinical or subclinical risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer.1 Trial sample sizes ranged from 30 to 2161. The mean baseline BMI ranged from 25 to 39.2 (median, 33.4), and the mean age ranged from 22 to 66 years (median, 50.3 years). Fourteen trials were limited to women, and 4 trials were restricted to men.1 Eleven trials focused on specific racial/ethnic groups (eg, African American, Asian and South Asian, American Indian, or Hispanic). Socioeconomic status was not well reported in trials; however, when described, most participants were of medium to high socioeconomic status. Most trials did not stratify results by BMI or BMI category, age, race/ethnicity, or health status.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although some trials included participants who were overweight, the average BMI in the majority of trials was in the obese range (median BMI, &gt;33).1 Therefore, the USPSTF was unable to examine the differential effects of interventions among participants who were overweight or had obesity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Nine trials focused on behavior-based weight loss maintenance.1 Study sites were in the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, and Australia. In most trials (8 trials), participants came from an unselected population of adults who were overweight or had obesity. One trial enrolled participants with cardiovascular risk factors.1 Trial sample sizes ranged from 92 to 1032. Participants were required to meet weight loss goals before enrollment. The mean BMI at enrollment ranged from 28.4 to 41.7 and the mean age ranged from 46.4 to 61.8 years (median, 49.2 years).1 One trial was limited to women, and 1 trial was limited to men. The majority of trials did not report information regarding race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. When this information was reported, participants were mostly white and of medium to high socioeconomic status.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Behavior-Based Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Few health outcomes were identified in the behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance trials (20 trials [n&#8197;=&#8197;9910]). There were no significant differences in mortality between intervention and control groups (4 trials [n&#8197;=&#8197;4442]). There were also no significant differences in cardiovascular events between intervention and control groups (2 trials [n&#8197;=&#8197;2666]).1 Trials that examined health-related quality of life (17 trials [n&#8197;=&#8197;7120]) mostly demonstrated a lack of statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Intermediate outcomes (eg, prevalence of high blood pressure or the metabolic syndrome, use of cardiovascular disease medications, or estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease) were seldom reported. Effects of interventions on cardiovascular disease risk, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension or hyperlipidemia diagnoses, and medication use were mixed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thirteen behavior-based weight loss trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;4095) evaluated incident type 2 diabetes in intervention vs control groups. Twelve of the 13 trials enrolled participants with impaired fasting glucose or increased risk for type 2 diabetes (ie, persons with a family history of diabetes or personal history of gestational diabetes or the metabolic syndrome). In the good-quality Diabetes Prevention Program trial (n&#8197;=&#8197;1295), the estimated cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes at 3 years was 14.4% vs 28.9% in the intervention vs placebo groups, respectively, and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of diabetes was 6.8. The good-quality Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (n&#8197;=&#8197;523) demonstrated that participants in the intervention group were significantly less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those in the control group after 9 years (40.0% vs 54.5%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3 to 0.7]). In the remaining trials, the differences between the intervention and control groups were not statistically significant. However, these trials were smaller and shorter than the larger trials. Pooling the trials (9 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;3140) showed a significant reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes over 1 to 9 years (pooled risk ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89]; I2&#8197;=&#8197;49.2%).1, 27-29</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Participants in behavior-based weight loss intervention groups demonstrated greater weight loss and decreased waist circumference compared with those in control groups at 24 months of follow-up. At 12 to 18 months, pooled results showed greater weight loss among intervention participants (&minus;2.39 kg [&minus;5.3 lb] [95% CI, &minus;2.86 to &minus;1.93]; 67 trials [n&#8197;=&#8197;22,065]; I2&#8197;=&#8197;90.0%).1 The mean absolute change in weight ranged from &minus;0.5 kg (&minus;1.1 lb) to &minus;9.3 kg (&minus;20.5 lb) among intervention groups and from 1.4 kg (3.1 lb) to &minus;5.6 (&minus;12.3 lb) among control groups. At 12 to 18 months, intervention participants were more likely to lose 5% of their initial weight compared with control participants (risk ratio, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.70 to 2.22]; 38 trials [n&#8197;=&#8197;12,231]; I2&#8197;=&#8197;67.2%; number needed to treat&#8197;=&#8197;8).1 Participants in weight loss maintenance interventions had less weight gain compared with participants in control groups (pooled mean difference in weight change, &minus;1.59 kg [&minus;3.5 lb] [95% CI, &minus;2.38 to &minus;0.79]; 8 studies [n&#8197;=&#8197;1408]; I2&#8197;=&#8197;26.8%).1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pharmacotherapy-Based Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pharmacotherapy trials evaluated liraglutide (4 trials), lorcaserin (4 trials), naltrexone and bupropion (3 trials), orlistat (21 trials), and phentermine-topiramate (3 trials) in combination with behavioral counseling.1 The review of pharmacotherapy-based trials focused on trials that used dosages approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. All trials were fair quality. Across all trials, both study groups (ie, placebo and pharmacotherapy groups) received the same behavioral interventions. The trials were conducted in the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and other regions. Participant characteristics were similar to those in the behavioral intervention trials. Many trials required participants to demonstrate medication adherence, meet weight loss goals before enrollment, or both. The more narrowly defined inclusion criteria of these trials resulted in more selective populations enrolled as study participants.1 Meta-analyses could not be conducted because of the few number of trials for each drug or variability in outcome reporting.1 The rate of trial completion in the medication and placebo groups ranged from 10% to 93% (most ranged from 50% to 70%).1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ten trials of pharmacotherapy-based interventions (n&#8197;=&#8197;13,145) examined quality of life outcomes.1 Many trials showed improvement in obesity-specific quality of life measures among participants receiving pharmacotherapy compared with placebo. However, these outcomes are difficult to interpret because of high dropout rates (&ge;35% in half of the included trials), the small differences between study groups, and the unclear clinical significance of improved quality of life scores.1 Trials that reported cardiovascular events found few events in any group (2 trials [n&#8197;=&#8197;6210]). Pharmacotherapy-based weight loss maintenance trials did not report any health outcomes.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Limited data from 4 trials examined weight loss medication and incident diabetes (n&#8197;=&#8197;9763) and found a reduced risk of diabetes. However, these trials were limited by high dropout rates.1, 26 Other intermediate outcomes (use of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications, prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, and 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease) were sparsely reported and had mixed findings.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At 12 to 18 months, participants in pharmacotherapy-based weight loss trials (32 trials) had more weight loss compared with placebo groups (mean or least squares mean difference in weight change, &minus;1.0 kg [&minus;2.2 lb] to &minus;5.8 kg [&minus;12.8 lb]).1, 26 Participants also experienced a greater decrease in waist circumference and a greater likelihood of losing 5% of their initial weight compared with placebo groups. Three pharmacotherapy-based weight loss maintenance trials showed that participants receiving the intervention had better weight loss maintenance compared with placebo groups over 12 to 36 months (mean difference, &minus;0.6 to &minus;3.5 kg).1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Behavior-Based Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF looked for evidence on potential harms of behavioral weight-loss interventions, including increased risk for fractures, serious injuries resulting from increased physical activity, and an increased risk for eating disorders, weight stigma, and weight fluctuation. Thirty trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;12,824) examined the harms of behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions. Fifteen trials were good quality and 15 trials were fair quality. Intervention harms were sparsely reported. Overall, the trials showed no serious harms, and most trials observed no difference in the rate of adverse events between intervention and control groups. Three trials demonstrated mixed results for musculoskeletal problems.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pharmacotherapy-Based Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pharmacological agents for weight loss have multiple potential harms, including anxiety, pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms with liraglutide; dizziness and cognitive impairment with lorcaserin; nausea, constipation, headache, and dry mouth with naltrexone and bupropion; cramps, flatus, fecal incontinence, and oily spotting with orlistat; and mood disorders, elevated heart rate, and metabolic acidosis with phentermine-topiramate. These harms have not been well studied. Thirty-three trials and 2 observational studies (n&#8197;=&#8197;239,428), all fair quality, assessed the harms of pharmacotherapy-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions. Serious adverse events were uncommon and similar between groups.1 Adverse event rates were high in both intervention and placebo groups by 12 months, with 80% to 96% of participants experiencing an adverse event in the medication group compared with 63% to 94% in the placebo group. The higher rate of adverse events in the medication groups resulted in higher dropout rates than in the placebo groups.1 Other limitations of the pharmacotherapy studies include a small number of trials for each medication, methodological variability, missing data, poor follow-up, and limited applicability (participants met narrowly defined inclusion criteria).26</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions in adults with obesity can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels; these interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (including weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity are small to none.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive behavioral interventions or behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions has a moderate net benefit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Various environmental and genetic factors play an important role in the development of obesity. After obesity has developed, an individual&rsquo;s biological mechanisms work to sustain the body&rsquo;s weight gain.30 Changes in neuronal signaling decrease satiety and perceptions of the amount of food eaten. As a result, weight loss can be challenging.31 Weight gain can progressively increase over the life span of an adult until later in life. Weight declines after the sixth decade of life.32 An increasing BMI may lead to increased long-term health risks. Losing weight may reduce the risk for illness and mortality and improve overall health.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></p>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 20 to March 19, 2018. In response to comments, the USPSTF expanded the description of behavioral counseling interventions in the Clinical Considerations section. In the Discussion section, the USPSTF clarified why persons who are overweight were not included in the recommendation statement, expanded the description on harms of behavioral counseling interventions and pharmacotherapy, and added the limitations of pharmacotherapy trials.</p>",

      "rationale": "<p><strong>Importance</strong></p>\r\n<p>Intimate partner violence and abuse of older or vulnerable adults are common in the United States but often remain undetected. Although estimates vary, IPV (including sexual violence, physical violence, and stalking) is experienced by approximately 36% of US women and 33% of US men during their lifetime. Severe physical violence is experienced by 21% of US women and 15% of US men during their lifetime.1 Prevalence rates vary by age, race/ethnicity, and income. Estimates also vary for prevalence of elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable adults. A 2008 nationwide survey of US adults 60 years or older found that the prevalence of any abuse or neglect in the past year was 10%.2 A 2004 survey of Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies found 40,848 substantiated reports of vulnerable adult abuse (in those aged 18 to 59 years) in 19 states.3</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the immediate effects of IPV, such as injury and death, there are other health consequences, many with long-term effects, including development of mental health conditions such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal behavior; sexually transmitted infections; unintended pregnancy; and chronic pain and other disabilities.4, 5 Violence during pregnancy is associated with preterm birth and low birth weight6 and adverse effects on maternal and infant health, including postpartum mental health problems7 and hospitalization during infancy.8</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Long-term negative health effects from elder abuse include death,9 higher risk of nursing home placement10 among those referred to APS, and adverse psychological consequences (distress, anxiety, and depression).11</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Detection</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that available screening instruments can identify IPV in women. The USPSTF found limited evidence about the performance of IPV screening instruments in men.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the accuracy of screening instruments designed to detect elder abuse or abuse of vulnerable adults when there are no recognized signs and symptoms of abuse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that effective interventions that provide or refer women to ongoing support services can reduce violence, abuse, and physical or mental harms in women of reproductive age. However, the USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence that screening for IPV can reduce violence, abuse, and physical or mental harms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The recommendation on screening for IPV applies to women of reproductive age because the evidence demonstrating benefit of ongoing support services is predominantly found in studies of pregnant or postpartum women. The USPSTF extrapolated the evidence pertaining to interventions with ongoing support services from pregnant and postpartum women to all women of reproductive age.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on screening or interventions for IPV in men.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening or early detection of elder abuse or abuse of vulnerable adults reduces exposure to abuse, physical or mental harms, or mortality in older or vulnerable adults.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of screening or interventions for IPV. Limited evidence showed no adverse effects of screening or interventions for IPV. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of the overall harms of screening and interventions for IPV can be bounded as no greater than small. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening or interventions for elder abuse or abuse of vulnerable adults.</p>",
      "clinical": "<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to women of reproductive age and older or vulnerable adults without recognized signs and symptoms of abuse. The studies reviewed for IPV included adolescents to women in their 40s.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>See below for suggestions for practice regarding men and older and vulnerable adults.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Definitions of IPV and Elder Abuse</strong></p>\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;intimate partner violence&rdquo; refers to physical violence, sexual violence, psychological aggression (including coercive tactics, such as limiting access to financial resources), or stalking by a romantic or sexual partner, including spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends, dates, and casual &ldquo;hookups.&rdquo; Severe physical violence includes being hit with a fist or something hard, kicked, hurt by pulling hair, slammed against something, hurt by choking or suffocating, beaten, burned on purpose, or threatened with a knife or gun.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;elder abuse&rdquo; refers to acts whereby a trusted person (eg, a caregiver) causes or creates risk of harm to an older adult.12 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), an older adult is considered to be 60 years or older.12 The legal definition of &ldquo;vulnerable adult&rdquo; varies by state but is generally defined as a person who is or may be mistreated and who, because of age, disability, or both, is unable to protect him or herself.3 Types of abuse that apply to older or vulnerable adults include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional or psychological abuse, neglect, abandonment, and financial or material exploitation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>\r\n<p>Although all women of reproductive age are at potential risk for IPV and should be screened, a variety of factors increase risk of IPV, such as exposure to violence as a child, young age, unemployment, substance abuse, marital difficulties, and economic hardships.13 However, the USPSTF did not identify any risk assessment tools that predict greater likelihood of IPV in populations with these risk factors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Risk factors for elder abuse include isolation and lack of social support, functional impairment, and poor physical health.14 For older adults, lower income and living in a shared living environment with a large number of household members (other than a spouse) are associated with an increased risk of financial and physical abuse.15</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>\r\n<p>Several screening instruments can be used to screen women for IPV. The following instruments accurately detect IPV in the past year among adult women: Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, Kick (HARK); Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream (HITS); Extended&ndash;Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream (E-HITS); Partner Violence Screen (PVS); and Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>HARK includes 4 questions that assess emotional and physical IPV in the past year. HITS includes 4 items that assess the frequency of IPV, and E-HITS includes an additional question to assess the frequency of sexual violence. PVS includes 3 items that assess physical abuse and safety. WAST includes 8 items that assess physical and emotional IPV.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Most studies only included women who could be separated from their partners during screening, during the intervention, or both, so screening and the intervention could be delivered in private.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>State and local reporting requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another, with differences in definitions, whom and what should be reported, who should report, and to whom. Some states require clinicians (including primary care providers) to report abuse to legal authorities, and most require reporting of injuries resulting from guns, knives, or other weapons.16 For elder abuse, mandatory reporting laws and regulations also vary by state; however, most states require reporting.17</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no valid, reliable screening tools in the primary care setting to identify IPV in men without recognized signs and symptoms of abuse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no valid, reliable screening tools in the primary care setting to identify abuse of older or vulnerable adults without recognized signs and symptoms of abuse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screening Interval</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate intervals for screening. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening and interventions for IPV often screen for current IPV or IPV in the past year.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interventions</strong></p>\r\n<p>No studies definitively identified which intervention components resulted in positive outcomes. However, based on the evidence from 3 studies,18-20 effective interventions generally included ongoing support services that focused on counseling and home visits, addressed multiple risk factors (not just IPV), or included parenting support for new mothers. See the Box for more information about the components of effective ongoing support services. These studies were conducted in pregnant or postpartum women. Studies that only included brief interventions and provided information about referral options were generally ineffective.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement and Other Populations</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Potential Preventable Burden</strong></p>\r\n<p>Older or vulnerable adults. Prevalence estimates of elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable adults vary. A 2008 nationwide survey of US adults 60 years or older found that the prevalence of any abuse or potential neglect in the past year was 10%.21 Elder abuse has a number of long-term negative health effects, including death,9 higher risk of nursing home placement10 among those referred to APS, and adverse psychological consequences (distress, anxiety, and depression).11 A 2004 survey of APS agencies identified 40,848 substantiated reports of vulnerable adult abuse (in those aged 18-59 years) in 19 states.3</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Women not of reproductive age. Based on the age categories reported by the CDC, approximately 4% of women aged 45 to 54 years and more than 1% of women 55 years or older have experienced rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in the past 12 months.22</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Men. More than 33% of men have experienced sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.1 Approximately 34% of men report any psychological aggression by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Among men who experience sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking, more than 10% experience at least 1 form of an IPV-related adverse effect, such as feeling fearful, feeling concerned for safety, injury, missing days of work or school, and needing medical care.1</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Potential Harms</strong></p>\r\n<p>Some potential harms of screening in older or vulnerable adults, women not of reproductive age, and men are shame, guilt, self-blame, retaliation or abandonment by perpetrators, partner violence, and the repercussions of false-positive results (eg, labeling and stigma).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Current Practice</strong></p>\r\n<p>Older or vulnerable adults. Limited evidence suggests that screening is not commonly occurring in practice; 1 study found that more than 60% of clinicians have never asked their older adult patients about abuse.23</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Women. While not specific to age, evidence suggests that screening for IPV is not commonly occurring in practice. A recent systematic review found that rates of routine screening vary and are typically low, ranging from 2% to 50% of clinicians reporting &ldquo;always&rdquo; or &ldquo;almost always&rdquo; routinely screening for IPV.24</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Men. No data are available on current screening practice in men.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Violence (2017&ndash;2020) identifies priorities for reducing IPV, including training the health care and public health workforce to address IPV.25 HRSA also developed a toolkit26 for clinicians and health centers to help implement screening and interventions for IPV. The National Hotline on Domestic Violence has information about local programs and resources across the country.27 The Administration for Children and Families has funded a compendium of state statutes and policies on domestic violence and health care.28</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The CDC,29 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&ndash;HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions,30 US Department of Veterans Affairs,31 Administration for Community Living,32 and the Administration on Aging&rsquo;s National Center for Elder Abuse33 also have additional resources available for clinicians.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on primary care interventions for child maltreatment;34 screening for depression in adolescents,35 adults, and pregnant women;36 screening for alcohol misuse;37 and screening for drug misuse.38</p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are several key research gaps related to IPV. The USPSTF recognizes that a significant body of evidence is lacking for men. The CDC has conducted studies demonstrating the prevalence and importance of IPV in men; however, there is a lack of research on screening and interventions to prevent IPV in men. Research is needed in all areas related to the accuracy of screening tools for men, and trials are needed that examine the effectiveness (benefits and harms) of screening and interventions for IPV in the primary care setting in men without recognized signs and symptoms of abuse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>More research is also needed on the most effective characteristics of ongoing support services for reducing IPV. In particular, more RCTs that compare the benefits and harms of screening (plus ongoing support services or referral for women who screen positive) vs no screening are needed, where support services may include more frequent and intensive interventions such as home visits, cognitive behavioral therapy, or other forms that address multiple risk factors. These studies should evaluate the optimal duration, format, and method of delivery.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Trials of ongoing support services should enroll women of all ages, including nonpregnant women and women beyond reproductive age. These trials will help with understanding the types of postscreening, ongoing support services that can be most effective, and the patients for whom they are most effective.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>More research is also needed in all areas related to the accuracy of screening tools in the primary care setting for elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable adults when there are no recognized signs and symptoms of abuse. High-quality RCTs are also needed on the effectiveness (benefits and harms) of screening and interventions in the primary care setting to prevent such abuse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation replaces the 2013 USPSTF recommendation. It is consistent with the 2013 USPSTF recommendation, which was a B recommendation for women of childbearing age and an I statement for abuse in older or vulnerable adults. This recommendation incorporates new evidence since 2013 and provides additional information about the types of ongoing support services that appear to be associated with positive outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians,54 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),55 American Academy of Neurology,56 American Academy of Pediatrics,57 Institute of Medicine Committee on Preventive Services for Women,58 and the HRSA-supported Women&rsquo;s Preventive Services Guidelines59 are in favor of screening for IPV. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for IPV in all women of childbearing age and providing interventions for those who screen positive. ACOG recommends screening for IPV in all pregnant women and offering ongoing support services. The American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics states that clinicians should routinely ask about physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.60 The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care61 and the World Health Organization62 indicate that current evidence does not justify universal screening for IPV. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends primary prevention interventions that aim to prevent or reduce IPV and sexual violence among youth.63 The American Academy of Neurology56 and ACOG64 recommend screening for elder abuse. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care61 concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to warrant a recommendation for screening.</p>",
      "discussion": "<p><strong>Burden of Disease</strong></p>\r\n<p>Intimate partner violence is a significant public health problem. According to the CDC, 36% of US women and 33% of US men experience sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime.1 The prevalence of lifetime psychological aggression is 36.4% in women and 34.3% in men. Lifetime severe physical violence is experienced by 21% of women and 15% of men.1 The most commonly reported effects of IPV include feeling fearful (61.9% of women and 18.2% of men) and concern for safety (56.6% of women and 16.7% of men).39 Women and men with a history of sexual violence, stalking, or physical violence committed by an intimate partner were more likely to report experiencing asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty sleeping, and limitations in their activities than women and men without a history of such violence.39</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Intimate partner violence is more common in younger women; thus, women of reproductive age have a higher prevalence of IPV than older women. Approximately 14.8% of women aged 18 to 24 years have experienced rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in the past 12 months, compared with 8.7% of women aged 25 to 34 years, 7.3% of women aged 35 to 44 years, 4.1% of women aged 45 to 54 years, and 1.4% of women 55 years or older.22 Intimate partner violence during pregnancy can have significant negative health consequences for women and children, including depression in women, low birth weight and preterm birth, and perinatal death.6, 7</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Abuse of older or vulnerable adults is also a significant public health problem. Estimates of prevalence vary. A nationally representative survey (N&#8197;=&#8197;3005) of community-dwelling adults aged 57 to 85 years estimated that 9% had experienced verbal mistreatment, 3.5% financial mistreatment, and 0.2% physical mistreatment by a family member.40 Among older adults, intimate partners constitute the minority of perpetrators in substantiated reports of elder abuse. According to data from a national survey of APS agencies, across all substantiated abuse reports involving a known perpetrator among adults older than 60 years (N&#8197;=&#8197;2074), approximately 11% of reports involved a spouse or intimate partner. The most common perpetrators of elder abuse are adult children (about 33% of cases) and other family members (about 22% of cases).3</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found few studies reporting on recent estimates of the prevalence of abuse in populations of vulnerable adults. The 1995&ndash;1996 National Violence Against Women Survey (N&#8197;=&#8197;6273) found that women with severe disability impairments were 4 times more likely to experience sexual assault in the past year than women without disabilities.41</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Scope of Review</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2013 recommendation on screening for IPV, elder abuse, and abuse of vulnerable adults. The scope of this review is similar to that of the prior systematic review, but in the current review42, 43 the USPSTF also examined the evidence on IPV in men and adolescents. The current review did not examine screening or interventions for perpetration of IPV.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Accuracy of Screening Tests</strong></p>\r\n<p>The review identified 15 fair-quality studies (n&#8197;=&#8197;4460) assessing the accuracy of 12 different IPV screening tools. All studies enrolled adults, and most enrolled only women or a majority of women; 1 study included only men.44 The recruitment settings varied; 5 studies recruited from emergency departments, 4 from primary care practices, 1 from urgent care, and 3 by telephone or mail survey. Most studies assessed a tool designed to identify persons experiencing IPV within the past year; however, 4 studies reported on the accuracy of 5 tools for identifying current (ongoing) abuse, 1 assessed the accuracy of detecting lifetime abuse, and 1 assessed the accuracy of a tool for predicting future (within 3 to 5 months) abuse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Five studies reported on the accuracy of 5 different screening tools (HARK, HITS, E-HITS, PVS, and WAST) for detecting any past-year IPV in adult women. Sensitivity ranged from 64% to 87% and specificity from 80% to 95%. Most screening tools were assessed by only 1 study.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Four studies reported on the accuracy of 5 screening tools for identifying ongoing or current abuse. Across all studies, accuracy varied widely (sensitivity, 46%-94%; specificity, 38%-95%). One tool, the Ongoing Violence Assessment Tool (OVAT), had acceptable sensitivity (86%) and specificity (83%) compared with the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One study enrolling men only from an emergency department reported on the accuracy of the PVS and HITS for detecting past-year IPV; sensitivity was low for both PVS and HITS for detecting psychological abuse (30% and 35%, respectively) and physical abuse (46% for both).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The review identified 1 fair-quality study assessing the accuracy of screening for abuse in the primary care setting in older adults when abuse is not suspected.45 Screening was conducted using the Hwalek-Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test (H-S/EAST), which includes 15 items. Compared with the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) (violence/verbal aggression scales combined), the H-S/EAST had a sensitivity of 46% (95% CI, 32%-59%) and specificity of 73.2% (95% CI, 62%-82%).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The review found no studies on the effectiveness of screening questionnaires or tools in identifying abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>Overall, 3 RCTs (n&#8197;=&#8197;3759) found no direct benefit of screening for IPV in adult women (mean age range, 34-40 years) when screening was followed by brief counseling or referral. There were no significant differences between screening and control groups over 3 to 18 months for IPV, quality of life, depression, PTSD, or health care utilization outcomes. The RCTs compared universal screening for IPV in a health care setting with no screening; 1 study enrolled participants from 10 US primary care clinics, 1 from a single New Zealand emergency department, and 1 from a variety of Canadian clinical settings (12 primary care sites, 11 emergency departments, and 3 obstetrics-gynecology clinics). No RCTs enrolled men or adolescents, and none focused on pregnant women or reported outcomes separately by pregnancy status. Women who screened positive received brief counseling and referral; the trials did not directly provide ongoing support services, and the proportion of women who received more intensive services after referral was not reported.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Eleven RCTs (n&#8197;=&#8197;6740) evaluated an IPV intervention in adult women with screen-detected IPV or women considered at risk for IPV. Five RCTs enrolled women during the perinatal period; all reported on IPV outcomes. Of these, the studies that were effective generally involved ongoing support services, which included multiple visits with patients, addressed multiple risk factors (not just IPV), and provided a range of emotional support and behavioral and social services. Two home-visit interventions19, 20 found lower rates of IPV in women assigned to the intervention group than in those assigned to the control group; however, the difference between groups was small (standardized mean difference, &minus;0.04 and &minus;0.34, respectively), and only 1 study found a statistically significant difference (standardized mean difference, &minus;0.34 [95% CI, &minus;0.59 to &minus;0.08]).19</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Of the 3 RCTs enrolling pregnant women with screen-detected IPV that evaluated a counseling intervention, 2 found benefit in favor of the intervention.18, 46 One trial only reported on subtypes of violence; the benefit was significant for some subtypes of violence (psychological and minor physical abuse) but not others (severe physical and sexual abuse).46</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One RCT assessing an integrated behavioral counseling intervention in women with 1 or more risk factors (smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, depression, and IPV) reported on birth outcomes among the subgroup with IPV at baseline; significantly fewer women in the intervention group delivered very preterm neonates (&le;33 weeks of gestation).47 Many women with IPV at baseline (62%) also screened positive for depression and received counseling for depression in addition to counseling for IPV. Two RCTs reported on depression, and both found benefit in favor of the intervention (only 1 found a statistically significant benefit46); 1 of these studies also reported on PTSD symptoms and found similar scores in both groups.48</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Six RCTs enrolled nonpregnant women; 4 measured changes in overall IPV incidence and found no significant difference between groups in rates of overall IPV exposure49, 50 or combined physical and sexual violence;51, 52 measures of IPV were either similar between groups or slightly higher in the intervention group. Two RCTs measured changes in quality of life after an IPV intervention; in both trials, scores were similar between intervention and control groups and differences were not statistically significant.49, 53 Interventions in nonpregnant women primarily included brief counseling, provision of information, and referrals but did not directly provide ongoing support services, and the proportion of women who received more intensive services after referral was not reported.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The review identified no eligible screening or intervention studies on IPV in men.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The review identified no eligible studies on elder abuse or abuse of vulnerable adults.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>Two fair-quality RCTs reported on harms of screening and identified no adverse effects of screening. One RCT developed a specific tool, the Consequences of Screening Tool (COST), to measure the consequences of IPV screening, such as &ldquo;Because the questions on partner violence were asked, I feel my home life has become (less difficult&hellip; more difficult).&rdquo; Results indicated that being asked IPV screening questions was not harmful to women immediately after screening. Scores were similar across groups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Five good- or fair-quality RCTs assessing IPV interventions reported on harms. No study found significant harms associated with the interventions. One RCT49 assessing a brief counseling intervention surveyed women at 6 and 12 months about survey participation (including potential harms); there was no difference between groups in the percentage of women who reported potential harms, and the authors concluded no harms were associated with the intervention. Among women who reported that their abusive partner was aware of their participation in the trial, the number of negative partner behaviors (eg, got angry, made her more afraid for herself or her children, or restricted her freedom) was not significantly different between groups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The review identified no eligible studies on IPV in men.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The review identified no eligible studies on elder abuse or abuse of vulnerable adults.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for IPV in women of reproductive age and providing or referring women who screen positive to ongoing support services has a moderate net benefit. There is adequate evidence that available screening instruments can identify IPV in women. The evidence does not support the effectiveness of brief interventions or the provision of information about referral options in the absence of ongoing supportive intervention components. The evidence demonstrating benefit of ongoing support services is predominantly found in studies of pregnant or postpartum women. Studies that demonstrated no clear benefit in nonpregnant women, however, did not directly provide ongoing support services. Therefore, the USPSTF extrapolated the evidence pertaining to interventions with ongoing support services in pregnant and postpartum women to all women of reproductive age. More research is needed that includes ongoing support services for women who are not pregnant or postpartum or who are beyond reproductive age.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Because of the lack of evidence, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits and harms of screening for elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable adults are uncertain and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. More research is needed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></p>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 24, 2018, to May 21, 2018. The USPSTF reviewed all comments and made revisions to the recommendation as appropriate. Some comments asked for clarification about the patient population, including whether men and older women were included in the recommendation. In response, the USPSTF clarified that it examined the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for IPV in women of all ages and in men; the recommendation is based on the available evidence. Some comments suggested screening instruments for elder abuse. The USPSTF reviewed the suggested tools; however, none of the suggested screening instruments met the USPSTF&rsquo;s inclusion criteria (eg, those screening tools were developed or tested in populations with recognized signs or symptoms of abuse). The USPSTF clarified the types of screening instruments that are needed in the Research Needs and Gaps section. Last, the USPSTF added more details on the research gaps and suggested resources for practitioners.</p>",

There were reductions in both the odds of exceeding recommended drinking limits and heavy use episodes at 6- to 12-month follow-up. In pregnant women, brief counseling interventions increased the likelihood that women remained abstinent from alcohol use during pregnancy. The magnitude of these benefits is moderate. Epidemiologic literature links reductions in alcohol use with reductions in risk for morbidity and mortality and provides indirect support that reduced alcohol consumption may help improve some health outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation8\">8</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that brief behavioral counseling interventions in adolescents were associated with reduced alcohol use.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF bounds the harms of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adults, including pregnant women, as small to none, based on the likely minimal harms of the screening instruments, the noninvasive nature of the interventions, and the absence of reported harms in the evidence on behavioral interventions.

The AUDIT has 10 questions: 3 questions covering frequency of alcohol use, typical amount of alcohol use, and occasions of heavy use, and 7 questions on the signs of alcohol dependence and common problems associated with alcohol use (eg, being unable to stop once you start drinking).

The most commonly reported intervention component was use of personalized normative feedback sessions, in which participants were shown how their alcohol use compares with that of others; more than half of the included trials and almost all trials in young adults used this technique.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Most trials in young adults involved 1 or 2 in-person or web-based personalized normative feedback sessions in university settings. Personalized normative feedback was often combined with motivational interviewing or more extensive cognitive behavioral counseling. Other cognitive behavioral strategies, such as drinking diaries, action plans, alcohol use &ldquo;prescriptions,&rdquo; stress management, or problem solving were also frequently used. About one-third of the intervention trials in general and older adult populations involved a primary care team.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF was unable to identify specific intervention characteristics or components that were clearly associated with improved outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence to suggest that patients of different race/ethnicity or lower socioeconomic status have a lower likelihood of benefit from interventions.

Although difficult, conducting a trial with an unscreened comparison group to understand the population-level effects of screening in primary care settings would be valuable. More direct evidence is needed on the harms associated with screening and behavioral interventions. The USPSTF found a preliminary study that evaluated the USAUDIT and USAUDIT-C, recent US adaptations of the AUDIT and AUDIT-C. Further test performance studies are needed to confirm their accuracy in identifying unhealthy alcohol use in various populations. More evidence on important clinical outcomes is needed, such as longer-term morbidity, mortality, health care utilization, and social and legal outcomes. Trials designed a priori to report subgroup effects in diverse populations (eg, by age, sex, race/ethnicity, or baseline severity) would be useful. Limited evidence is available to assess the effects of screening and behavioral counseling in adolescents, and high-quality studies specifically addressing this population are needed.

Screening instruments addressed a variety of elements, such as quantity of drinks, drinking frequency, or typical total number of drinks over a specific period (quantity&#8197;&times;&#8197;frequency), and a variety of response categories and cutoffs.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Reference standards were structured diagnostic interviews (eg, Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule, or Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus). Some studies used a diagnostic interview in combination with other instruments (eg, in combination with the ASSIST, to identify the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use) or a timeline follow-back interview.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>For adults, the AUDIT, AUDIT-C, and 1- or 2-item screening tests had acceptable sensitivity and specificity to detect the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use. Studies of the SASQ reported sensitivity of 0.73 to 0.88 (95% CI range, 0.65-0.89) and specificity of 0.74 to 1.00 (95% CI range, 0.69-1.00) for detecting unhealthy alcohol use (4 studies [n&#8197;=&#8197;44,461]). Other 1- or 2-item screening tests generally showed sensitivity of 0.70 or greater. The standard of 6 or more drinks per occasion tended to have decreased sensitivity compared with the standard of 5 (men)/4 (women) or more drinks, often with nonoverlapping confidence intervals. Other adult populations (young adults, older adults, and pregnant women) had similar results.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Seven studies (n&#8197;=&#8197;8852) evaluating the AUDIT for the detection of unhealthy alcohol use in general adult populations, using the recommended cutoff of higher than 8, reported a wide range of sensitivity (0.38-0.73 [95% CI, 0.33-0.84]) but high specificity (0.89-0.97 [95% CI, 0.84-0.98]). In many studies, sensitivity improved at lower cutoffs. Three studies (n&#8197;=&#8197;2782) conducted in US primary care settings showed better accuracy (sensitivity, 0.64-0.86 [95% CI, 0.57-0.91] and specificity, 0.74-0.94 [95% CI, 0.68-0.95] at cutoffs of 3, 4, or 5).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Sensitivity of the AUDIT-C for detecting unhealthy alcohol use in adults was similar to that of 1- or 2-item screening instruments.

The majority of trials (60%) were conducted in the United States. Intervention settings were predominantly in primary care clinics (62%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Two trials were in adolescents, 22 in college-aged or young adults, 29 in general adult populations, 4 in older adults, and 11 in pregnant or postpartum women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Trials were generally limited to study participants who reported a prespecified level of alcohol use on a screening instrument such as the AUDIT. Outcomes were generally reported at 6- to 12-month follow-up or during the late pregnancy/early postpartum period for abstinence during pregnancy. Trials demonstrated high heterogeneity; effect size was not clearly associated with any intervention characteristics. Data on effectiveness in important subpopulations were very limited.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The most commonly reported subpopulation analysis (by sex) did not show differences in the effectiveness of the interventions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The most commonly reported alcohol use outcome was number of drinks per week. Among 37 adult trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;15,974), adults in intervention groups reduced the number of drinks per week more than adults in control groups (weighted mean difference between groups in change from baseline, &minus;1.59 [95% CI, &minus;2.15 to &minus;1.03;&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;63%).

Analyses limited to trials conducted in US primary care settings suggest that effects in the most applicable trials were comparable or larger than the overall effect (weighted mean difference, &minus;2.82 [95% CI, &minus;3.87 to &minus;1.76]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Interventions among adults resulted in an absolute increase of 14% more participants drinking within recommended limits, meaning 7 adults would need to be treated to achieve 1 adult drinking within recommended limits (number needed to treat, 7.2 [95% CI, 6.2 to 11.5]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Interventions increased the proportion of pregnant women reporting abstinence (OR, 2.26 [95% CI, 1.43 to 3.56]).

One good-quality and 5 fair-quality trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;3650) reported on harms. There was very limited evidence on intervention harms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Interventions reviewed and discussed above generally reported benefits, including reductions in alcohol consumption. Therefore, paradoxical and theoretical increases in alcohol use with interventions are unlikely.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>Adequate evidence supports a moderate beneficial effect of screening for unhealthy alcohol use followed by brief behavioral counseling interventions in adults. Screening and behavioral counseling interventions in the primary care setting can reduce unhealthy drinking behaviors in adults, including heavy episodic drinking, high daily or weekly levels of alcohol consumption, and exceeding recommended drinking limits. Although the USPSTF found limited specific evidence for pregnant women, it determined that available studies of behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in pregnant women supported increased likelihood of alcohol abstinence during pregnancy with intervention.</p>\r\n<p>Available studies have not focused on the effects of screening and behavioral counseling interventions on longer-term health outcomes, such as alcohol-related disease or death. However, adequate epidemiologic evidence links reduced levels of alcohol consumption with a reduced risk for morbidity and mortality, providing indirect support that behavioral counseling interventions that reduce acute and sustained alcohol intake levels can help improve some health outcomes of unhealthy alcohol use.8 A large body of observational evidence also links alcohol use in pregnant women with an increased risk for subsequent birth defects, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation50\">50</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions#citation51\">51</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Given the noninvasive nature of screening and behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use, the USPSTF determined the magnitude of harms to be small to none in adults and pregnant women. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adults, including pregnant women, is moderate.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence in adolescents is limited. As such, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 5, 2018, to July 2, 2018. Some comments expressed concerns about the lack of discussion of specific populations. In response, the USPSTF added language about the harms of alcohol consumption in adolescents to the Clinical Considerations section and the harms of alcohol use during pregnancy to the Discussion section. The USPSTF also added more useful resources to the Clinical Considerations section. Some comments requested clarification on which screening tools were being discussed; the USPSTF clarified this by adding references.</p>",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission (abuse) or omission (neglect) by a parent or other caregiver (eg, clergy, coach, or teacher) that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Words or actions that are deliberate and cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm are considered acts of commission (eg, physical, sexual, and psychological abuse).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Failure to provide for a child&rsquo;s basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm constitutes an act of omission (neglect).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Approximately 676,000 US children experienced abuse or neglect in 2016.1 Of those, 1700 died as a result of that maltreatment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Younger children appear to be the most vulnerable, with nearly 25 per 1000 children younger than 1 year identified as having experienced maltreatment.1 Abuse and neglect can result in long-term negative physical and emotional effects. Risk factors for maltreatment in children include young age (&lt;4 years), having special health care needs, female sex, and past history of maltreatment. Children are also at increased risk based on factors related to their caregiver or environment, including having young, single, or nonbiological parents or parents with poor educational attainment, low income, history of maltreatment, and social isolation. Additionally, living in a community with high rates of violence, high rates of unemployment, or weak social networks are linked to child maltreatment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation3\">3</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed risk assessment instruments used to identify children for whom preventive interventions might be indicated and found limited and inconsistent evidence on the validity and reliability of these tools.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation3\">3-5</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found a lack of evidence on the harms associated with interventions to prevent child maltreatment. Potential harms of preventive interventions include social stigma and effects on family functioning and dynamics.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Because of the recommended schedule of periodic health assessments, primary care clinicians, including pediatricians, family clinicians, and others, are uniquely positioned to identify child maltreatment. The Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act sets minimum standards for state laws overseeing the reporting of child abuse and neglect.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Forty-eight states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands mandate that professionals who have contact with children report suspected child maltreatment to Child Protective Services (CPS).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;An estimated 3.4 million children were referred to CPS in 20161; however, there is evidence that many cases of child abuse and neglect are not reported.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation7\">7</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Several factors may play a role in the underreporting of child maltreatment, including missed diagnosis of intentional child injury, fear of alienating caregivers, and stigma related to CPS involvement.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation8\">8</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;Signs and symptoms of child abuse include, but are not limited to, frequent injuries or unexplained/inconsistent explanation of injury cause, signs of poor hygiene, or lack of medical care; frequent absences from school; being excessively withdrawn or fearful; unexplained changes in behavior; trouble walking or sitting; and displaying knowledge of sexual acts inappropriate for age.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation8\">8</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Preventive interventions initiated in primary care focus on preventing maltreatment before it occurs.</p>\r\n<h3>Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Although the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against preventive interventions in primary care settings, several strategies for preventing child abuse and neglect have been studied. Specific interventions include primary care programs designed to identify high-risk patients and refer them to community resources, parent education to improve nurturing and increase the use of positive discipline strategies, and psychotherapy to improve caregivers&rsquo; coping skills and strengthen the parent-child relationship.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;These interventions are delivered in settings such as primary care clinics, schools, and the community.</p>\r\n<p>Most available research included in the evidence review is from studies of home visitation programs.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;These programs usually involve a professional or paraprofessional (eg, peer educator or community health worker) providing periodic counseling, educational services, or support in a family&rsquo;s home. Families are identified and referred most often by health care professionals in the prenatal and immediate postpartum period. These services contain multiple components, including assessing family needs, providing information and referrals, providing clinical care, and enhancing family functioning and positive child-parent interactions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;All states and the District of Columbia, as well as tribal and territorial entities, have home visitation programs to support families with young children.

      "other": "<h3>Research Gaps and Needs</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes the importance of this serious health problem and calls for the prioritization of research to address gaps in numerous areas related to child maltreatment. There is limited evidence supporting the use of risk-assessment instruments to identify children at risk of maltreatment. Further research to determine effective methods for clinicians to identify children at increased risk should be a priority.</p>\r\n<p>Although most studies included home visitation, there was significant heterogeneity in study design and outcome measurements. Standardization of outcome measurement across trials would greatly strengthen the evidence base and improve the ability to pool data. Additionally, research on home visitation should base interventions on proven and well-designed theoretical models. Without this type of contextual information, it will be difficult to interpret whether inventions are successful and, if so, how those interventions worked. When investigating interventions and outcomes, the inclusion of diverse populations and settings would help improve the applicability of study findings. These would include families with known risk factors for child maltreatment (eg, history of substance abuse in the home) and settings with limited access to social services. In addition, future research is needed to determine whether there are unintended harms from risk assessment and preventive interventions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>\r\n<p>There are varying recommendations related to the primary prevention of child maltreatment.

This includes interventions delivered in the primary care setting or by referral to other resources such as home visitation programs, respite care, parent education, and family support and strengthening programs. Outcomes were characterized as direct or proxy measures. Direct measures include direct evidence of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or neglect; reports to CPS; and removal of the child from the home. Proxy measures include injuries with a high specificity of abuse, visits to the emergency department or hospital, and failure to provide for the child&rsquo;s medical needs. Other measures reviewed include social, emotional, and developmental outcomes. The review focused on primary prevention; evidence on interventions in children with signs or symptoms of maltreatment or known exposure to child maltreatment is outside the scope of work of the USPSTF.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed studies of children without signs or symptoms of maltreatment who received interventions to prevent child maltreatment delivered in or referred from primary care. The main outcomes were reduced exposure to maltreatment; improved behavioral, emotional, mental, or physical well-being; and reduced mortality. The USPSTF reviewed a total of 22 randomized clinical trials (from 33 publications) of good or fair quality. Of those 22 trials, 12 were included in the 2013 review and 10 were newly identified. There were several similarities in study characteristics across the 22 included trials, including the mother&rsquo;s age (&ge;20 years) (15 trials), usual-care comparator (19 trials), US setting (16 trials), and, similar to the 2013 review, a home visitation component (21 trials).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation4\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Although most trials featured home visits, the components of the interventions varied by content, personnel, intensity, duration, and use of other supporting elements. Fifteen of the 21 home visitation trials used clinical personnel in some capacity. These personnel included nurses (7 trials), mental health professionals (2 trials), paraprofessionals (4 trials), and peer home visitors (1 trial).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/child-maltreatment-primary-care-interventions1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;The remaining trials did not specify the training of the home visitors.

The level of certainty of the magnitude of the benefits and harms of these interventions is low.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 22 to June 18, 2018. Several comments expressed concern that studies of other interventions (such as the Safe Environment for Every Kid [SEEK] model) were not adequately reviewed by the USPSTF. The USPSTF reviewed all suggested studies and found that they did not meet eligibility requirements for inclusion, primarily because the studies were rated as poor quality or did not report eligible outcomes. Studies that included the SEEK model were included in the sensitivity analysis but did not change outcomes. Comments also voiced concern about the accuracy of disparities statistics, noting that racial biases can affect reporting of child maltreatment. The USPSTF revised the recommendation in response to these comments. Comments noted that the USPSTF conflated the potential harms of primary prevention of maltreatment with harms associated with reporting maltreatment. The USPSTF revised the language to reflect only potential harms associated with preventive interventions. In addition, some comments asked for clarification about the clinician&rsquo;s role in preventing child maltreatment. The USPSTF recognizes the important role clinicians play in identifying and reporting child maltreatment. The Current Practice section indicates that this recommendation applies to children who do not have signs or symptoms of maltreatment and that professionals and caregivers are obligated by law to report suspected child maltreatment. The USPSTF also made changes to the Summary of Recommendation and Evidence section to emphasize this point.</p>",

Several comments questioned the continued need for universal prophylaxis given the relative low rate of disease. The USPSTF reaffirmed its recommendation based on several factors, including the rapid course and serious adverse effects of infection, increasing rates of gonococcal infection, and the large number of persons who do not receive screening for gonococcal infection during pregnancy in the United States. Comments also supported risk-based prophylaxis as an alternative strategy for prevention. However, there are no tools for assessing the risk of infection in newborns and no studies examining the use of risk-based vs universal prophylaxis. The USPSTF revised the recommendation to clarify this point. In addition, a number of comments promoted the use of iodine solutions (povidone-iodine) as an alternative to erythromycin ophthalmic ointment. The evidence review found limited studies on the use of iodine solutions and notes that they are not approved for use in the United States as ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. The USPSTF added language to address this concern.</p>",

Symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest are required and must be present for a minimum of 2 weeks.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;The diagnosis should not be confused with the less severe postpartum &ldquo;baby blues,&rdquo; which is a commonly experienced transient mood disturbance consisting of crying, irritability, fatigue, and anxiety that usually resolves within 10 days of delivery.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation21\">21</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In the United States, the estimated prevalence of major depressive disorder in the postpartum period ranges from 8.9% among pregnant women to 37% at any point in the first year postpartum.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation22\">22</a></sup>&nbsp;Rates vary by age, race/ethnicity, and other sociodemographic characteristics. For example, women 19 years or younger, American Indian/Alaska Native women, women with less than 12 years of education, unmarried women, or women with 6 or more stressful life events in the previous 12 months have higher reported rates of perinatal depression.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation23\">23</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>It is well established that depression during the postpartum period can lead to adverse effects on the mother and infant. Although acts of harming oneself or the fetus or newborn are rare, perinatal depression increases the risk of suicide and suicidal ideation, and mothers with depression report more thoughts of harming their infants than mothers without depression.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;Women with perinatal depression exhibit significantly higher levels of negative maternal behaviors (ie, hostile or coercive behaviors or both) and disengagement from their infants than women without perinatal depression.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Women with perinatal depression are also more likely to exhibit significantly lower levels of positive maternal behaviors, such as praising and playing with their child.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Perinatal depression is linked to an increased risk of preterm birth, small for gestational age newborn, and low birth weight.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation26\">26</a></sup>&nbsp;Infants whose mothers have perinatal depression are at increased risk of early cessation of breastfeeding<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation27\">27</a></sup>&nbsp;and have been shown to receive fewer preventive health services (ie, vaccinations) compared with infants whose mothers are without depressive symptoms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation28\">28</a></sup>&nbsp;Perinatal depression can also affect a child&rsquo;s cognition and emotional development. Children of mothers who had perinatal depression demonstrate more behavior problems, lower cognitive functioning, and increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation29\">29</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation30\">30</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Risk Factors</h3>\r\n<p>A number of risk factors are thought to be associated with the development of perinatal depression.

Additional risk factors include adolescent parenthood, low socioeconomic status, and lack of social support.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation37\">37</a></sup>&nbsp;Genetic factors are also suspected to contribute to women&rsquo;s risk of developing perinatal depression.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation38\">38</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;to evaluate the evidence on the potential benefits and harms of preventive interventions for perinatal depression in pregnant or postpartum women or their children. The review focused on studies of interventions involving pregnant women and new mothers of any age who were both selected and unselected based on known risk factors. The review included studies of women with mental health symptoms or disorders, although studies targeting women with a depression diagnosis, women with high levels of depressive symptoms, or women currently being treated for a depressive disorder were excluded, as were studies of women with psychotic or developmental disorders. The USPSTF reviewed contextual information on the accuracy of tools used to identify women at increased risk of perinatal depression and the most effective timing for preventive interventions. Interventions reviewed included counseling, health system interventions, physical activity, education, supportive interventions, and other behavioral interventions, such as infant sleep training and expressive writing. Pharmacological approaches included the use of nortriptyline, sertraline, and omega-3 fatty acids.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed studies of pregnant and postpartum women who received interventions to prevent perinatal depression delivered in or referred from primary care. The main reported outcomes were depression status (measured as cumulative incidence, point prevalence, or scoring above a cutoff on a symptom severity scale) and continuous depression symptom scale scores. Other health outcomes such as quality of life, infant or child outcomes, and functioning were also reported by trials and considered by the USPSTF. The USPSTF reviewed a total of 50 good- or fair-quality studies (49 randomized clinical trials, 1 nonrandomized controlled intervention study). The studies were divided between those that targeted pregnant (26/50 [52%]) or postpartum (22/50 [44%]) women. Two trials recruited pregnant women as well as women up to 26 weeks postpartum.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Most studies (42/50 [84%]) were limited to women 18 years or older, and the mean age across studies was 28.6 years. Twenty-six of the studies (52%) selected women with risk factors for perinatal depression. These included a personal or family history of depression (or perinatal depression), elevated depressive symptoms, socioeconomic factors (eg, low income, single or without partner, young age, or recent intimate partner violence), and other mental health factors (elevated anxiety symptoms or history of significant negative life events).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;The majority of participants in the included studies were non-Hispanic white women, although 2 studies were limited to Latina women and 8 had a majority black and Latina population. Nearly one-fourth of the included studies (13/50 [26%]) were primarily or entirely composed of economically disadvantaged women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Twenty trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;4107) reported on counseling interventions. More than half were conducted in the United States (12/20 [60%]), most were limited to adults (older than 18 years) (17/20 [85%]), and most initiated interventions during pregnancy (17/20 [85%]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Three-quarters of the trials were limited to women known to be at increased risk of perinatal depression because of depression history or symptoms (6/20 [30%]); non&ndash;depression-related risk factors such as low socioeconomic status, recent intimate partner violence, or young age (3/20 [15%]); or depression-related or other risk factors (6/20 [30%]). Almost two-thirds (13/20 [65%]) of the trials excluded women who met diagnostic criteria for current major depression or scored above the cutoff on a symptom severity scale. Most of the interventions (13/20 [65%]) used cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy approaches. Counseling interventions lasted a median of 8 weeks and had a median of 12 hours of total contact time.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;The interventions consisted of both group (15/20 [75%]) and individual (11/20 [55%]) sessions, with some involving both types.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Settings included in-person (19/20) or telephone-based meetings (2/20), and 4 trials included home visits. Across all counseling interventions, half to three-quarters of sessions were attended by participants.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>When the outcomes of incidence, prevalence, and scoring above the cutoff on a symptom severity scale were combined, counseling interventions were associated with a 39% reduction in the likelihood of perinatal depression (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.78]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Assuming a 19% baseline risk of perinatal depression (ie, the median percentage of women with depression in control groups at 3 to 6 months postpartum across all included studies), this corresponds to a number needed to treat of 13.5 women (95% CI, 9.9 to 23.9). Compared with the overall effect of counseling interventions, studies reporting the use of cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy approaches showed similar effects.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Subgroup analysis of trials using the &ldquo;Mothers and Babies&rdquo; and ROSE programs showed pooled RR reductions of 53% and 50%, respectively.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;When analyzing the effect of counseling interventions by study population, trials that selected women at increased risk of perinatal depression (based on symptoms, history of depression, or social or socioeconomic risk factors) demonstrated a larger positive effect compared with trials enrolling lower-risk, unselected populations (45% vs 21% risk reduction, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Thirteen trials reported continuous symptom score measures, with 5 trials demonstrating statistically significant group differences.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation7\">7</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation8\">8</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation11\">11</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation39\">39</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation40\">40</a></sup>&nbsp;Counseling interventions were associated with a small beneficial effect in symptom scores, resulting in a pooled standardized effect size of 0.2, or an average 1.5-point greater reduction in depression symptom severity compared with control groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Trials reported other maternal or child outcomes; however, outcome measures widely varied and there was little consistency across studies.

Participants taking sertraline were more likely than those taking placebo to report dizziness (57% vs 13%, respectively;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&#8197;=&#8197;0.05) and drowsiness (100% vs 50%, respectively;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&#8197;=&#8197;0.02).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation55\">55</a></sup>&nbsp;One woman taking nortriptyline and 1 woman taking sertraline developed mania or hypomania, but there were no cases among women taking placebo.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation55\">55</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/perinatal-depression-preventive-interventions#citation56\">56</a></sup>&nbsp;No harms were associated with omega-3 fatty acids. None of the other included intervention trials reported harms outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that counseling interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, are effective in preventing perinatal depression. Based on the population of women included in the studies, those with a history of depression, current depressive symptoms, or certain socioeconomic risk factors (eg, low income or young or single parenthood) would benefit from counseling interventions and could be considered at increased risk. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of counseling interventions as no greater than small, based on the nature of the intervention and the low likelihood of serious harms. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the benefits and harms of other noncounseling interventions. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that providing or referring pregnant or postpartum women at increased risk to counseling interventions has a moderate net benefit in preventing perinatal depression.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 28 to September 24, 2018. Several comments requested that the recommendation be expanded to include associated mood disorders (such as anxiety disorder). The primary focus of the USPSTF recommendation and evidence review was depression. Several additional outcomes (including anxiety) were included in the scope of the evidence review; however, reporting on incidence or symptoms of anxiety was limited and inconsistent. Several comments questioned why perinatal depression screening tools such as the EPDS were not recommended as risk-assessment tools. Additionally, comments requested that the USPSTF clarify the population at risk that would benefit from counseling interventions. The focus of this recommendation is the prevention of depression; the USPSTF has a separate recommendation on screening for depression in all adults, including pregnant women. The Research Gaps and Needs section calls for more studies on the use of tools for risk assessment, including established screening tools. For this recommendation, the USPSTF defined increased risk based on the study population; the USPSTF made revisions to further identify who would be considered at increased risk of depression. Several comments raised concerns about the ability of clinicians to implement the recommendation because of barriers to accessing mental health services. The USPSTF recognizes these barriers and provided some additional information about mental health resources and systems to connect patients to appropriate care in the Implementation section and Additional Approaches to Prevention of Depression section.</p>",

Potential harms are false-positive capillary blood test results, anxiety, inconvenience, and financial costs associated with return visits and repeated tests. Children with significantly elevated blood lead levels might receive chelation therapy, which is associated with a wide range of harms, including injection site pain or abscess, headache, paresthesia, tremors, rash, neutropenia, elevation of serum liver transaminase, hypertension, tachycardia, fever, nausea, vomiting, or other gastrointestinal upset.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>There are no data on the proportion of clinicians who screen for elevated blood lead levels in children without symptoms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF found no data on the prevalence of screening for elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women in primary care settings.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Bright Futures recommends screening in accordance with state law and universal screening at ages 12 and 24 months in states with no screening program in place.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;The Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment program requires that all children receive a screening blood lead test at ages 12 and 24 months; children aged 36 to 72 months must receive a screening blood lead test if they have not been previously screened for lead poisoning.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Blood tests or questionnaires may be used to screen for elevated blood lead levels. Elevated blood lead levels can be detected by measuring free erythrocyte or zinc protoporphyrin levels and capillary or venous blood lead levels. Capillary blood testing is recommended for initial screening. However, false-positive results can occur if capillary blood samples become contaminated. Patients with positive screening results from capillary blood samples should have confirmatory venous blood testing.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Questionnaires have been developed to identify children at increased risk of elevated blood lead levels. The most commonly used questionnaire is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) screening questionnaire. The CDC questionnaire asks 5 questions about the following: living in or visiting a house built before 1960 with chipping paint or undergoing renovation, having a sibling or close contact being monitored or treated for lead poisoning (defined as a blood lead level &gt;15 &mu;g/dL), living with an adult exposed to lead through work or hobbies, and living near lead-based industry. A positive or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; answer to any of the questions indicates the need for a blood lead test.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;There are no validated questionnaires to identify pregnant women at high risk of lead exposure.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Patients with an elevated blood lead level should have confirmatory venous blood testing. Management is based on the lead level and symptoms. Treatment options include residential lead hazard control measures, educational interventions (eg, counseling on household dust control measures), environmental interventions (eg, soil abatement, dust or paint removal, or removal of contaminated water sources), chelation therapy, and nutritional interventions. Finding the source of lead exposure is essential in preventing repeated or future exposures.</p>\r\n<p>In most settings, education and counseling is offered to children with blood lead levels ranging from 10 to 20 &mu;g/dL. Some experts also recommend nutritional counseling for children with blood lead levels in this range. Residential lead hazard control measures are usually offered to children with blood lead levels of 20 &mu;g/dL or greater, while chelation therapy is offered to children with blood lead levels of 45 &mu;g/dL or greater.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Educational interventions focus on parental counseling about lead exposure, hygiene, and household dust control measures to prevent the ingestion of dust and soil. Environmental interventions include specialized cleaning, repairs, maintenance, soil abatement (eg, removal and replacement), painting, and temporary containment of lead hazards.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Calcium, dietary iron, and other supplements are thought to decrease the intestinal absorption of lead. However, the role of nutritional interventions (ie, supplementation) in reducing blood lead levels remains unclear.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Chelation therapy is recommended for symptomatic patients with moderate or severe lead toxicity. Dimercaprol (or its less toxic analog, dimercaptosuccinic acid [DMSA], also known as succimer) is a commonly used agent that removes lead from the blood and soft tissues. Penicillamine is less commonly used.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Management of elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women also varies depending on the lead level and consists of education and environmental interventions, nutritional interventions, and chelation therapy.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup></p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Research is needed to better inform decisions about screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women, such as the development of validated questionnaires to identify at-risk populations most likely to benefit from screening. Studies reporting intermediate and health outcomes, outcomes in newborns, and harms in women and infants are needed, as well as studies evaluating effective interventions for reducing blood lead levels in pregnant women. Research is also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for elevated blood lead levels in trials with adequate sample sizes to inform treatment strategies. However, randomized trials may not always be appropriate for screening and environmental interventions because of ethical issues. Well-designed research studies are needed on the benefits of nutritional supplementation in reducing blood lead levels in children. Research on newer approaches to detecting elevated blood lead levels, such as point-of-care testing, that include intraindividual and interlaboratory reliability would be useful for assessing screening strategies in children and pregnant women. Different sources of lead exposure that are now emerging in at-risk communities are not well incorporated into current screening questionnaires. Research on screening and prevention in these populations remains limited. Additional research is needed to validate these potential risk factors in specific geographic locations and among at-risk populations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 2006, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children aged 1 to 5 years at increased risk (I recommendation).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommended against routine screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children aged 1 to 5 years at average risk (D recommendation). The USPSTF also recommended against routine screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic pregnant women (D recommendation).</p>\r\n<p>The understanding of lead exposure has changed considerably since 2006. No safe level of lead exposure has been established, and since the previous USPSTF recommendation, the reference level to identify children with elevated blood lead levels has been lowered from 10 to 5 &mu;g/dL. Other sources of lead that could affect blood lead levels may now be more prevalent than in 2006, and these sources were not studied in the currently available evidence. There is a lack of evidence on interventions that can be done in a clinical setting that would improve health outcomes. A change in the context and applicability of older evidence resulted in the USPSTF assessing the evidence on harms of treatment as inadequate. As a result, the USPSTF determined that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels, leading the USPSTF to issue an I statement for both populations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against routine screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children aged 1 to 5 years at average risk, and found insufficient evidence on screening in children at increased risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening based on federal, state, and local requirements; in children living in high-prevalence areas (communities with &ge;25% of housing built before 1960 or a prevalence of blood lead levels &ge;5 &mu;g/dL of &ge;5%); in children with identified lead hazards or living in a home built before 1960 that is in poor repair or renovated in the past 6 months; or in children who are immigrants, refugees, or internationally adopted.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;The Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment program requires that all children receive a screening blood lead test at ages 12 and 24 months; children aged 36 to 72 months must receive a screening blood lead test if they have not been previously screened for lead poisoning.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Bright Futures recommends screening in accordance with state law and universal screening at ages 12 and 24 months in states with no screening program in place.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;The CDC and the American College of Preventive Medicine recommend screening in children at increased risk for lead exposure.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation25\">25</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against routine screening for elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women without symptoms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend targeted screening during pregnancy and lead testing in pregnant and lactating women with 1 or more risk factors for lead exposure, such as environmental or occupational exposures or pica.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation26\">26</a></sup></p>",

According to National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey data and the Child Blood Lead Surveillance System, 8.8% of children aged 1 to 5 years had blood lead levels of 10 &mu;g/dL or greater from 1976 to 1980 and 4.4% of children had elevated blood lead levels from 1991 to 1994. By 1999 to 2002, prevalence had decreased to 1.6%, and from 2007 to 2010 it was only 0.8%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;However, blood lead levels in younger children increased from 2007 to 2010, with 3.1% of 1- to 2-year-olds having blood lead levels of 5 &mu;g/dL or greater.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Risk factors for lead exposure include socioeconomic factors (eg, lower family income, older housing, and poor nutritional status), living near an industry that involves lead, proximity to the renovation or deterioration of older houses with lead-based paint, and previously living in countries where lead exposure is high. The risks vary by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and housing. From 2007 to 2010, the prevalence of blood lead levels of 5 &mu;g/dL or greater in children aged 1 to 2 years was 7.7% in non-Hispanic black children, 3.2% in non-Hispanic white children, and 1.6% in Mexican American children. Prevalence was 3.1% in boys and 3.2% in girls, and much higher in lower-income populations. Children living in housing built before 1950 are 5 times more likely to have blood lead levels greater than 5 &mu;g/dL than children living in housing built after 1978.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Elevated levels of lead in the body affect various organ systems, including the cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic systems, with most symptoms occurring at blood lead levels of 50 &mu;g/dL or greater. Very high levels of inorganic lead exposure may result in death or long-term neurologic symptoms in children.

Studies also suggest that mildly elevated maternal blood lead levels during pregnancy may be associated with increased risk for spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, and adverse effects on fetal growth. Although very high blood lead levels during pregnancy are harmful, the adverse effects of elevated antepartum blood lead levels on the fetus, at least for the range of exposure typically found in the United States, have not been established.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation11\">11</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2006 recommendation<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/elevated-blood-lead-levels-in-childhood-and-pregnancy-screening#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;on screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women.

Persons at risk of HIV infection include men who have sex with men, persons at risk via heterosexual contact, and persons who inject drugs.

Men who have sex with men and women are at risk of HIV acquisition and should be evaluated for PrEP according to the criteria outlined above for men who have sex with men and heterosexually active men.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Transgender women and men who are sexually active may be at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. The CDC estimates that approximately one-fourth of transgender women are living with HIV, and more than half (an estimated 56%) of black/African American transgender women are living with HIV.<span><span><span>4</span></span></span> Although trials of PrEP enrolled few transgender women and no trials have been conducted among transgender men, PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition during receptive and insertive anal and vaginal sex. Therefore, its use may be considered in all persons (cisgender and transgender) at high risk of sexual acquisition of HIV.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Consistent use of condoms decreases risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 80%<span><span><span>5</span></span></span> and also decreases the risk of other STIs. However, sexually active adults often use condoms inconsistently.<span><span><span>6</span></span></span> PrEP should be considered as an option to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in persons who use condoms inconsistently, while continuing to encourage and support consistent condom use.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>To date, in 3 studies, transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner living with HIV has not been observed when the seropositive partner was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.<span><span><span>7-9</span></span></span> It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a seropositive partner has a documented undetectable viral load.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The risk of acquisition of HIV infection is on a continuum. This risk depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner is living with HIV. The likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse, whereas condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex have a risk of transmission that is approximately 10- to 15-fold lower than receptive anal intercourse.<span><span><span>5</span></span></span> One recent study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown is living with HIV) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs,<span><span><span>10</span></span></span> although an earlier systematic review estimated the prevalence of HIV among persons who inject drugs to be much higher (16%).<span><span><span>11</span></span></span> The prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men and women is estimated to be intermediate between that of men who have sex with men and heterosexually active men.<span><span><span>12</span></span></span> Thus, persons at high risk of HIV acquisition via penile-vaginal intercourse, including those with a recent bacterial STI acquired via penile-vaginal intercourse, will generally be at lower absolute risk than persons at high risk via receptive anal intercourse or injection drug use. These are factors that clinicians and patients can consider as they discuss the use of PrEP for HIV prevention.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In addition, risk behaviors should be interpreted in the context of the HIV prevalence in a community or network; that is, risk behaviors in a high-prevalence setting carry a higher risk of acquiring HIV infection than the same behaviors in a low-prevalence setting. The threshold of HIV prevalence below which PrEP has insignificant net benefit is not known.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Preventive Medication</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Once-daily oral treatment with combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine is the only formulation of PrEP approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States in persons at risk of sexual acquisition of HIV infection. However, several studies reviewed by the USPSTF found that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone was also effective as PrEP, and CDC guidelines note that, given these trial data, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone can be considered as an alternative regimen for high-risk heterosexually active men and women and persons who inject drugs.<span><span><span>3</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>According to its product label, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine may be considered for use as PrEP during pregnancy.<span><span><span>13</span></span></span> No trials of oral PrEP included pregnant women; however, pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition.<span><span><span>14</span></span></span> CDC guidelines recommend shared decision making for pregnant women who are considering starting or continuing PrEP during pregnancy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Adolescents at high risk of HIV acquisition could benefit from PrEP, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine is approved by the FDA for use as PrEP in adolescents who weigh at least 35 kg.<span><span><span>13</span></span></span> In addition, young men who have sex with men are at particularly high risk of HIV acquisition.<span><span><span>15</span></span></span> However, no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of PrEP enrolled adolescents. Limited data suggest that PrEP use is not associated with significant adverse events in adolescents but may be associated with slightly less bone mineral accrual than would be expected.<span><span><span>16</span></span></span> The USPSTF suggests that clinicians weigh all these factors when considering PrEP use in adolescents at high risk of HIV acquisition. In addition, clinicians need to be aware of any local laws and regulations that may apply when providing PrEP to an adolescent minor.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Several additional approaches for decreasing risk of HIV acquisition are also available. Consistent use of condoms decreases risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 80%<span><span><span>5</span></span></span> and reduces the risk of other STIs. The USPSTF recommends intensive behavioral counseling to reduce behaviors associated with increased risk of STIs and HIV acquisition and to increase condom use among adolescents and adults at increased risk of STIs.<span><span><span>17</span></span></span> The CDC has made several recommendations, including abstinence, reducing one&rsquo;s number of sex partners, and consistent condom use, to decrease risk of STIs, including HIV.<span><span><span>18</span></span></span> The CDC also recommends syringe service programs (ie, needle exchange programs) to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission among persons who inject drugs.<span><span><span>19</span></span></span> The Community Preventive Services Task Force has also issued several recommendations on the prevention of HIV and other STIs.<span><span><span>20</span></span></span> Postexposure prophylaxis, started as soon as possible after a possible exposure event, can also decrease the risk of HIV infection.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Screening for HIV infection to detect undiagnosed cases and antiretroviral treatment in persons living with HIV to suppress viral load are both important approaches to decreasing the risk of HIV transmission at the population level, while also benefiting the individual living with HIV. The USPSTF recommends screening for HIV infection in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years, younger adolescents and older adults at increased risk, and all pregnant persons.<span><span><span>21</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Useful Resources</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>The CDC guidelines on PrEP for the prevention of HIV infection are available at <u><span><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2017.pdf\"><span>https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2017.pdf</span></a></span></u><span><span><span>3</span></span></span> and <u><span><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-provider-supplement-2017.pdf\"><span>https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-provider-supplement-2017.pdf</span></a></span></u>.<span><span><span>22</span></span></span> Additional CDC resources on PrEP for both clinicians and consumers are available at <u><span><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/index.html\"><span>https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/index.html</span></a></span></u>.<span><span><span>23</span></span></span> Community-level HIV prevalence data for the United States are available at <u><span><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/atlas\"><span>https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/atlas</span></a></span></u>.<span><span><span>24</span></span></span> The USPSTF has issued recommendations on behavioral counseling to reduce risk of STIs<span><span><span>17</span></span></span> and on screening for HIV infection.<span><span><span>21</span></span></span></span></p>",
      "other": "<p><u><span><strong>Other Considerations</strong></span></u></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Implementation</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>The first step in implementing PrEP is identifying persons at high risk of HIV acquisition who may benefit from PrEP. However, identifying persons at risk of HIV can be challenging because of stigma and discrimination against gay, bisexual, transgender, and nonbinary persons, or the lack of a trusting relationship between the patient and clinician. It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. If a person is identified as potentially belonging to a high-risk group, then further discussion can identify behaviors that may make that person an appropriate candidate for PrEP.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The CDC provides a complete discussion of implementation considerations for PrEP, including baseline and follow-up testing and monitoring, time to achieving protection, and discontinuing PrEP.<span><span><span>3</span></span></span> A few particularly important points regarding the provision of PrEP are outlined below.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Before prescribing PrEP, clinicians should exclude persons with acute or chronic HIV infection through taking a medical history and HIV testing. The 2-drug antiretroviral regimen used in PrEP, when used alone, is not an effective treatment for HIV infection, and its use in persons living with HIV can lead to the emergence of, or selection for, drug-resistant HIV infection. It is also generally recommended that kidney function testing, serologic testing for hepatitis B and C virus, testing for other STIs, and pregnancy testing (when appropriate) be conducted at the time of or just before initiating PrEP. Ongoing follow-up and monitoring, including HIV testing every 3 months, is also suggested. The time from initiation of PrEP to achieving protection against HIV infection is unknown. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that maximum levels of tenofovir diphosphate (the active form of tenofovir) is reached in 7 days in rectal tissue and in 20 days in blood (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and vaginal tissue.<span><span><span>3</span></span></span> Patients can continue PrEP as long as high risk of HIV acquisition continues. Patients may discontinue PrEP for several reasons, including personal preference, decreased risk of HIV acquisition, or adverse medication effects.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>PrEP does not reduce the risk of other STIs. Consistent use of condoms decreases risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 80%<span><span><span>5</span></span></span> and reduces the risk of other STIs. Promoting consistent condom use is an important component of a successful PrEP program. The CDC also recommends regular screening for STIs in men who have sex with men who are at high risk of STIs, and testing in anyone with signs or symptoms.<span><span><span>3</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Clinical trials demonstrate a strong connection between adherence to PrEP and its effectiveness in preventing HIV acquisition. Reduced adherence is associated with marked declines in effectiveness. Therefore, adherence support is a key component of providing PrEP. Components of adherence support include establishing trust and open communication with patients, patient education, reminder systems for taking medication, and attention to medication adverse effects and having a plan to address them. Additional information on adherence support is available from the CDC guidelines.<span><span><span>3,22</span></span></span> Adherence support is especially important in populations shown to have lower adherence to PrEP, such as young persons and racial/ethnic minorities.<span><span><span>25-27</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It is important for clinicians to recognize that barriers to the implementation and uptake of PrEP exist. These barriers can include structural barriers, such as lack of health insurance, and other factors, such as an individual&rsquo;s willingness to believe that he or she is an appropriate candidate for PrEP or to take PrEP. There are also racial/ethnic disparities in the use of PrEP. One study reported that although black/African American persons account for an estimated 44% of all new HIV infections in the United States, only 10.1% of those who initiated PrEP from 2012 to 2015 were black/African American. Similarly, black women, who are also disproportionately affected by HIV, were more than 4 times less likely to have initiated PrEP than white women.<span><span><span>28</span></span></span> These barriers and disparities need to be addressed to achieve the full benefit of PrEP.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Research is needed to develop and validate tools that are highly accurate for identifying persons at high risk of HIV acquisition who would benefit from PrEP. When developed and validated, risk assessment instruments should include those populations most at risk of HIV infection, particularly racial/ethnic minorities such as black/African American and Hispanic/Latino populations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Research is needed on different drug regimens and dosing strategies for PrEP. Several trials investigating different antiretroviral drugs or drug regimens for use as PrEP are ongoing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Research is needed on factors associated with adherence to PrEP and methods to increase uptake and adherence, especially in populations with lower use of and adherence to PrEP, such as younger persons and racial/ethnic minorities.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Trials or demonstration projects of PrEP in US populations of heterosexual persons, persons who inject drugs, and transgender women and men are needed to better quantify effectiveness in those populations. Research is needed on the safety and effectiveness of PrEP during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

In a meta-analysis of these trials, PrEP was associated with reduced risk of HIV infection compared with placebo or no PrEP (relative risk [RR], 0.46 [95% CI, 0.33-0.66]; absolute risk reduction, &minus;2.0% [95% CI, &minus;2.8% to &minus;1.2%]) after 4 months to 4 years.<span><span><span>31<span>,32</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>PrEP was effective across population subgroups defined by HIV risk category.

The third trial (Intervention Pr&eacute;ventive de l&rsquo;Exposition aux Risques avec et pour les Gays) found that event-driven PrEP dosing was associated with a lower risk of HIV infection compared with placebo in men who have sex with men (RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.03-0.63]).<span><span><span>40</span></span></span> In that trial, men randomly assigned to PrEP took an average of about 4 doses of PrEP per week (15 doses per month), so it is uncertain whether this finding would apply to less frequent use of event-driven dosing. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate accumulates more rapidly in anal tissue than vaginal tissue,<span><span><span>51</span></span></span> so this study may not be generalizable to other risk groups.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The USPSTF also evaluated the evidence on the relationship between adherence to PrEP and its effectiveness in decreasing risk of HIV infection. Methods for evaluating adherence differed between studies and included patient diaries and self-report, pill counts, adherence monitoring devices, drug levels (eg, plasma or dried blood spots), and prescription fill data.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In the trials of PrEP reviewed by the USPSTF, adherence to PrEP ranged from 30% to 100%, and the RR of HIV infection in participants randomly assigned to PrEP, compared with placebo or no PrEP, ranged from 0.95 to 0.07.<span><span><span>31<span>,32</span></span></span></span> In a stratified analysis of these studies, a strong interaction (<em>P</em>&#8197;&lt;&#8197;0.00001) between level of adherence and effectiveness of PrEP was found, with higher levels of adherence associated with greater reduction in risk of HIV acquisition (adherence &ge;70%: 6 trials; RR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.19-0.39]; adherence &gt;40% to &lt;70%: 3 trials; RR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38-0.70]; and adherence &le;40%: 2 trials; RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.72-1.20]).<span><span><span>31,32</span></span></span> There was also a strong association (<em>P</em>&#8197;&lt;&#8197;0.0005) between adherence and effectiveness when adherence was analyzed as a continuous variable in a meta-regression.<span><span><span>31<span>,32</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Since the effectiveness of PrEP is closely tied to adherence, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on levels of adherence to PrEP in US-relevant settings.

Having stable housing or having receptive anal sex without a condom with 2 or more partners was associated with increased adherence (adjusted odds ratio, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.14-3.55] and 1.82 [95% CI, 1.14-2.89], respectively). There was no association between age, educational attainment, income level, health insurance status, and alcohol or drug use and adherence. Only 1.4% of participants enrolled were transgender women, so it is not possible to draw conclusions about adherence to PrEP in this population. The USPSTF found no US studies on factors associated with adherence to PrEP in persons who inject drugs or persons at high risk of HIV infection via heterosexual contact.<span><span><span>31</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Potential Harms of Risk Assessment and Preventive Medication</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>The RCTs that investigated the effectiveness of PrEP had 4 months to 4 years of follow-up and also reported on the harms of PrEP.<span><span><span>25,40-50,55-62</span></span></span> In a pooled analysis of these studies, PrEP was associated with increased risk of renal adverse events (primarily grade 1 or greater serum creatinine elevation) vs placebo (12 trials; absolute risk difference, 0.56% [95% CI, 0.09%-1.04%]). There was no clear difference in risk of kidney adverse events when trials were stratified according to use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. Serious renal events were rare, and no trial reported a difference between PrEP and placebo in risk of serious renal events or withdrawals due to renal events.<span><span><span>31<span>,32</span></span></span></span> Six trials<span><span><span>41<span>,42,55-58</span></span></span></span> evaluated whether renal adverse events while using PrEP were persistent. Three studies<span><span><span>55,57<span>,58</span></span></span></span> reported a return to normal serum creatinine levels after cessation of PrEP, and 2 others<span><span><span>41,42</span></span></span> reported normalization of creatinine level without PrEP cessation. In 1 trial, the Bangkok Tenofovir Study of persons who inject drugs, there were 7 cases of grade 2 or greater creatinine level elevation, and all but 1 case resolved after PrEP cessation.<span><span><span>56</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>PrEP was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (primarily nausea) vs placebo (12 trials; absolute risk difference, 1.95% [95% CI, 0.48%-3.43%]). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events increased with both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine,<span><span><span>31</span></span></span> with risk diminishing over time in 3 trials.<span><span><span>45,46,48</span></span></span> Serious gastrointestinal events were rare in trials reporting this outcome, with no differences between PrEP and placebo.<span><span><span>44,46-50</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure is associated with bone loss,<span><span><span>48,59-61</span></span></span> which could result in increased fracture risk. A meta-analysis of 7 studies that reported on fractures, using both study data and updated fracture data reported to the FDA, found a statistically nonsignificant increased risk of fracture in persons randomly assigned to PrEP vs placebo. This result was also heavily weighted by the 1 study of PrEP in persons who inject drugs, which reported a relatively high fracture rate.<span><span><span>31<span>,32</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>One concern about PrEP is that its use may lead to persons at risk of HIV acquisition not using condoms or engaging in other behaviors that could increase their risk of STIs (ie, behavioral risk compensation). In meta-analyses of the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, there were no differences between PrEP and placebo or no PrEP in risk of syphilis (4 trials; RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.18]), gonorrhea (5 trials; RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.82-1.39]), chlamydia (5 trials; RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.80-1.18]), or combined bacterial STIs (2 trials; RR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.97-1.34]).<span><span><span>31<span>,32</span></span></span></span> All of the trials except for 1 were blinded, which could affect risk of STIs if participants who do not know if they are taking PrEP or placebo behave differently than those who know they are taking PrEP. In the 1 open-label trial, there was also no statistically significant association between PrEP and the risk of STIs.<span><span><span>50</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>An additional concern is the possibility that the use of antiretroviral drugs as PrEP could lead to the development or acquisition of drug-resistant HIV infection. In 8 trials of PrEP using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine, 3 of 282 patients (1.1%) newly diagnosed with HIV infection while taking PrEP had tenofovir resistance mutations.<span><span><span>40,43-47,49,50</span></span></span> In 6 trials of PrEP with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine, 14 of 174 patients (8.0%) newly diagnosed with HIV infection while taking PrEP had emtricitabine resistance mutations.<span><span><span>40,43,44,46,48-50</span></span></span> There was 1 case of multiple resistance mutations, which is included in the total number of both tenofovir and emtricitabine resistance mutations. Most resistance mutations (1/2 tenofovir resistance mutations, 8/13 emtricitabine resistance mutations, and 1 case of multiple resistance mutations, or 63% of total cases) occurred in persons who were already infected with HIV on trial enrollment but were not recognized as such. This highlights the importance of testing for HIV and excluding persons with acute or chronic HIV infection before initiating PrEP. The USPSTF found no data on the effect of resistance mutations on clinical outcomes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>No trial of oral PrEP enrolled pregnant women, and women who became pregnant during the course of the trials were withdrawn from participation. Three trials reported on pregnancy outcomes in women who were withdrawn from PrEP because of pregnancy.<span><span><span>41,48,62</span></span></span> Among women who became pregnant in the trials, PrEP was not associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion. One trial, the Partners PrEP trial, also found no differences between PrEP and placebo in pregnancy rate, risk of preterm birth, birth anomalies, or postpartum infant mortality.<span><span><span>62</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that PrEP is of substantial benefit in decreasing the risk of HIV infection in persons at high risk of HIV acquisition. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that adherence to PrEP is highly correlated with its efficacy in preventing the acquisition of HIV infection; thus, adherence to PrEP is central to realizing its benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that PrEP is associated with small harms, including renal and gastrointestinal adverse effects. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the magnitude of benefit of PrEP with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate&ndash;based therapy to reduce the risk of acquisition of HIV infection in persons at high risk is substantial.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>HIV is an RNA retrovirus that infects immune cells, in particular CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Antiretroviral agents interfere with 1 of several steps in viral infection and replication, such as HIV entry into CD4+ cells, reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA, integration of the viral genome into the host genome, and assembly of HIV proteins and RNA into new virus.<span><span><span>63</span></span></span> Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine are both reverse transcriptase inhibitors and have favorable safety profiles. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate achieves particularly high concentrations in rectal tissue, and emtricitabine achieves high concentrations in the female genital tract.<span><span><span>64</span></span></span> The possibility of using PrEP to prevent HIV transmission was suggested by the success of antiretroviral agents in preventing mother-to child transmission of HIV and their use as postexposure prophylaxis<span><span><span>65-67</span></span></span> and was demonstrated in several animal models, including 1 model showing that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine decreased the risk of rectal transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus in macaques.<span><span><span>68</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 20, 2018, to December 26, 2018.

In the same section, the USPSTF also added information about the high burden of HIV in transgender women and the risk of HIV transmission in persons living with HIV who have a suppressed viral load. The USPSTF also added details on the likelihood that specific activities will lead to the transmission of HIV and on the prevalence of HIV in different groups. The USPSTF addressed stigma, barriers to access to care, and racial/ethnic disparities as obstacles to the use of PrEP by persons and groups at high risk.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The USPSTF received comments requesting that it include a meta-analysis<span><span><span>69</span></span></span> examining the effects of PrEP on the risk of STIs in the evidence reviewed for this recommendation. In response, the USPSTF notes that it reviewed that particular meta-analysis; however, because of methodologic limitations of the studies included in the meta-analysis, such as not adjusting for differential STI testing rates and use of self-report to determine baseline STI rates, it was not included in the body of evidence considered for this recommendation. Last, the USPSTF added the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists committee opinion on the use of PrEP to the Recommendations of Others section.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>",

Based on the age-stratified incidence of HIV infection and data on sexual activity in youth, the USPSTF recommends screening for HIV infection beginning at age 15 years. Adolescents younger than 15 years and adults older than 65 years should be screened if they have risk factors for HIV infection.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Although all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years should be screened, there are a number of risk factors that increase risk. Among adolescents younger than 15 years and adults older than 65 years, clinicians should consider the risk factors of their patients, especially those with new sex partners, and offer testing to patients at increased risk.</p>\r\n<p>Most (67%) new diagnoses of HIV infection are attributed to male-to-male sexual contact,[[2]] and the estimated prevalence of HIV infection among men who have sex with men is 12%.[[3]] Injection drug use is another important risk factor for HIV infection; the estimated prevalence of HIV infection among persons who inject drugs is 1.9%.[[3]] In 2017, male individuals 13 years and older accounted for 81% of new diagnoses of HIV infection.[[2]] Most (83%) of these new diagnoses of HIV infection were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact, while 9% were attributed to heterosexual contact, 4% to injection drug use, and 4% to both male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use.[[2]] Among female individuals 13 years and older, 87% of all new diagnoses were attributed to heterosexual contact and 12% to injection drug use.[[2]]</p>\r\n<p>Additional risk factors for HIV infection include having anal intercourse without a condom, having vaginal intercourse without a condom and with more than 1 partner whose HIV status is unknown, exchanging sex for drugs or money (transactional sex), having other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or a sex partner with an STI, and having a sex partner who is living with HIV or is in a high-risk category. Persons who request testing for STIs, including HIV, are also considered at increased risk.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes that these risk categories are not mutually exclusive, that the degree of risk exists on a continuum, and that persons may not be aware of the HIV or risk status of their sex partner or the person with whom they share injection drug equipment. Patients may also be reluctant to disclose risk factors to clinicians.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Screening Tests</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Current CDC guidelines recommend testing for HIV infection with an antigen/antibody immunoassay approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and the HIV-1 p24 antigen, with supplemental testing after a reactive assay to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies.[[8,9]] If supplemental testing for HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies is nonreactive or indeterminate (or if acute HIV infection or recent exposure is suspected or reported), an HIV-1 nucleic acid test is recommended to differentiate acute HIV-1 infection from a false-positive test result.[[8,9]]</p>\r\n<p>Antigen/antibody tests for HIV are highly accurate, with reported sensitivity ranging from 99.76% to 100% and specificity ranging from 99.50% to 100%, and results can be available in 2 days or less.[[8]] Rapid antigen/antibody tests are also available.[[9]]</p>\r\n<p>When using a rapid HIV test for screening, positive results should be confirmed. Pregnant women presenting in labor with unknown HIV status should be screened with a rapid HIV test to get results as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Screening Intervals</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine appropriate or optimal time intervals or strategies for repeat HIV screening. Repeat screening is reasonable for persons known to be at increased risk of HIV infection, such as sexually active men who have sex with men; persons with a sex partner who is living with HIV; or persons who engage in behaviors that may convey an increased risk of HIV infection, such as injection drug use, transactional sex or commercial sex work, having 1 or more new (ie, since a prior HIV test) sex partners whose HIV status is unknown, or having other factors that can place a person at increased risk of HIV infection (see the Assessment of Risk section). Repeat screening is also reasonable for persons who live or receive medical care in a high-prevalence setting, such as a sexually transmitted disease clinic, tuberculosis clinic, correctional facility, or homeless shelter. The CDC recommends annual screening in persons at increased risk[[10]] but recognizes that clinicians may wish to screen high-risk men who have sex with men more frequently (eg, every 3 or 6 months) depending on the patient&rsquo;s risk factors, local HIV prevalence, and local policies.[[11]] Routine rescreening may not be necessary for persons who have not been at increased risk since they last tested negative for HIV.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on the yield of repeat prenatal screening for HIV compared with 1-time screening during a single pregnancy. The CDC[[10]] and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)[[12]] recommend repeat prenatal screening for HIV during the third trimester of pregnancy in women with risk factors for HIV acquisition and in women living or receiving care in high-incidence settings, and the CDC notes that repeat screening for HIV during the third trimester in all women who test negative early in pregnancy may be considered. Women screened during a previous pregnancy should be rescreened in subsequent pregnancies.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>No cure or vaccine for HIV infection currently exists. However, early initiation of ART and other interventions effectively reduce the risk of clinical progression to AIDS, AIDS-defining clinical events, and mortality. Also, studies to date have shown that when ART leads to viral suppression, no cases of virologically linked HIV transmission have been observed. Interventions other than ART include prophylaxis for opportunistic infections when clinically indicated, immunizations, and cancer screening. In addition, ART treatment in pregnant women living with HIV and use of other precautions substantially decrease the risk of transmission to the fetus, newborn, or infant.</p>\r\n<p>The clinical treatment of HIV infection is a dynamic scientific field. The Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents of the US Department of Health and Human Services regularly updates guidelines for HIV treatment regimens.[[13]]</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes that the most effective strategy for reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the United States is primary prevention, or avoidance of exposure to HIV infection. Avoiding behaviors that may convey an increased risk of HIV infection and consistent use of condoms can decrease the risk of transmission of HIV and other STIs. The USPSTF recommends providing intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk of STIs.[[14]]</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made several recommendations related to the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other STIs.[[15]]</p>\r\n<p>Prophylactic intervention with antiretroviral medications, both preexposure and postexposure, can prevent HIV infection. Postexposure prophylaxis is used in persons who do not have HIV and may have been exposed to it via sexual contact, occupational or nonoccupational needle stick or other injury, or sharing injection drug equipment. When initiated soon after possible exposure, postexposure prophylaxis can prevent HIV infection. Preexposure prophylaxis is used in persons who do not have HIV and are at high risk of acquiring HIV infection. It consists of antiretroviral medication taken every day, before potential exposure. The USPSTF recommends offering preexposure prophylaxis to persons at high risk of HIV acquisition.[[16]]</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Useful Resources</strong></h3>\r\n<p>More information about HIV and AIDS is available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://HIV.gov\">HIV.gov</a>[[17]] and from the CDC.[[18]] The CDC has made recommendations on screening for HIV in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women in health care settings[[10]] and the prevention of HIV transmission in adolescents and adults living with HIV;[[19]]&nbsp;guidelines on the use of ART and the potential adverse effects of ART are regularly updated at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/\">https://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov</a>.[[13]]</p>",
      "other": "<p><span><strong>Other Considerations</strong></span></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Implementation</strong></h3>\r\n<p>As recommended by the CDC, HIV screening should be voluntary and performed only with the patient&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding.[[10]] Patients should be informed orally or in writing that HIV testing will be performed unless they decline (known as &ldquo;opt-out screening&rdquo;). Patients should receive an explanation of HIV infection and the meaning of positive and negative test results. Patients should also be offered the opportunity to ask questions and to decline testing.</p>\r\n<p>The substantial benefit of screening is realized only if detection of HIV is followed by initiation of appropriate ART and provision of other services for persons found to have HIV. Thus, entry into care for persons identified as having HIV is essential. The CDC provides guidance on counseling, referral to care, treatment, and prevention of HIV transmission.[[19,20]] Clinicians should be aware that some persons with HIV may face substantial barriers to receiving appropriate services.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></h3>\r\n<h3>Research is needed on the yield of repeat vs 1-time screening for HIV and different repeat screening intervals to inform recommendations on optimal screening intervals. Data on optimal rescreening strategies in pregnant women are needed.</h3>\r\n<p>Persons who initiate ART tend to continue receiving it for an extended length of time. Thus, continued research on the potential harms of long-term use of ART is an important research need. Further research is also needed to understand the effects of in utero exposure to ART on pregnancy outcomes and long-term effects in exposed children, to optimize the selection of ART regimens during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Update of the Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>In 2013, the USPSTF recommended screening for HIV infection in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years, screening in younger adolescents and older adults at increased risk, and screening in all pregnant women.[[69]] The current updated recommendation continues to strongly recommend screening for HIV infection in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years, younger adolescents and older adults at increased risk, and all pregnant persons.<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>In 2006, the CDC recommended routine voluntary screening for HIV infection in all adolescents and adults aged 13 to 64 years, regardless of other recognized risk factors, unless HIV prevalence was documented to be less than 0.1% within a patient community.[[10]] The CDC recommends that all persons should be screened at least once in their lifetime and those with risk factors be screened more frequently (eg, annually); the CDC also recently recommended that clinicians consider testing sexually active men who have sex with men more frequently (eg, every 3 to 6 months) based on risk behaviors, community HIV prevalence, and other considerations.[[11]]</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, the American College of Physicians recommended routine screening for HIV infection.[[70]] The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends routine screening for HIV infection in all sexually active adults and pregnant women.[[71]] In 2017, ACOG reaffirmed a previous recommendation that all females aged 13 to 64 years be tested at least once in their lifetime and annually thereafter if they are assessed to have risk factors for HIV infection.[[72]] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal screening for HIV infection once between the ages of 15 and 18 years, and annual reassessment and testing of persons at increased risk.[[73]] The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2013 USPSTF recommendations, except it recommends that routine screening begin at age 18 years and that only adolescents at increased risk be tested at younger ages.[[74]]</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The CDC,[[10]] ACOG,[[12]] American Academy of Pediatrics,[[75,76]] American College of Physicians,[[70]] and American Academy of Family Physicians[[74]] recommend routine screening for HIV infection in all pregnant women using an opt-out approach, and rapid screening for women who present in labor whose HIV status is unknown. The CDC[[10]] and ACOG[[12]] recommend repeat testing during the third trimester in women with risk factors and in women living or receiving care in high-incidence settings who had a negative test result earlier in pregnancy; the CDC[[10]] notes that repeat testing in the third trimester may be considered for all women with a negative test result early in pregnancy.</p>",
      "discussion": "<h3><strong>Burden of Disease</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Since the first cases of AIDS were reported in 1981, more than 700,000 persons in the United States have died of AIDS.[[2]] The CDC estimates that 1.1 million persons in the United States are currently living with HIV infection, including an estimated 15% who are unaware of their infection.[[1,3,4]] The annual number of new HIV diagnoses in the United States has decreased slightly in recent years, from about 41,200 new diagnoses in 2012 to 38,300 in 2017.[[2]] Of new diagnoses of HIV infection in 2017, 81% were among males and 19% were among females.[[2]] Groups disproportionately affected by HIV infection in the United States include men who have sex with men, black/African American populations, and Hispanic/Latino populations. For example, the estimated overall prevalence of HIV infection in the United States is 0.4%, while the estimated prevalence among men who have sex with men is 12%.[[3]] From 2012 to 2017, HIV diagnosis rates increased in adults aged 25 to 29 years, as well as in the American Indian/Alaska Native population.[[2]]</p>\r\n<p>Perinatal HIV transmission has decreased substantially since its peak in 1992.[[6]] There were 99 diagnoses of perinatally acquired HIV infection in 2016,[[2]] and approximately 8700 women living with HIV give birth each year.[[5]] There are racial/ethnic disparities in rates of perinatally acquired HIV infection; rates are 5 times greater in black/African American women than in white or Hispanic/Latino women.[[21]] Of the 99 diagnoses of perinatally acquired HIV infection reported in 2016, 65% occurred in black/African American mothers.[[21]]</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Scope of Review</strong></h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review[[22,23]] on the benefits and harms of screening for HIV infection in nonpregnant adolescents and adults, the yield of screening for HIV infection at different intervals, the effects of initiating ART at a higher (ie, &gt;500 cells/mL<sup>3</sup>) vs lower CD4 (a type of white blood cell in the immune system) count, and the longer-term harms associated with currently recommended ART regimens. The USPSTF also commissioned a systematic evidence review[[24,25]] on the benefits (specifically, reduced risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection) and harms of screening for HIV infection in pregnant persons, the yield of repeat screening for HIV at different intervals during pregnancy, the effectiveness of currently recommended ART regimens for reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection, and the harms of ART during pregnancy to the mother and infant.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Accuracy of Screening Tests</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Currently recommended antigen/antibody tests for HIV are highly accurate, with reported sensitivity ranging from 99.76% to 100% and specificity ranging from 99.50% to 100%.[[8]] Recommended rapid HIV tests have similar sensitivity and somewhat lower reported specificity ranging from 98.6% to 100%.[[26]]</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or observational studies that compared clinical outcomes between adolescents and adults screened and not screened for HIV infection. The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the yield of repeated screening for HIV compared with 1-time screening or that compared the yield of different strategies for repeat screening (eg, risk-based screening vs routine repeat testing or repeat screening at different intervals) in adolescents and adults. The USPSTF also found no studies comparing the yield of 1-time vs repeat screening or of different frequencies of screening for HIV infection in pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 3 RCTs&mdash;the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN 052) trial (n&#8197;=&#8197;1763),[[27,28]] the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (INSIGHT START or START) trial (n&#8197;=&#8197;4685),[[29]] and the Early Antiretroviral Treatment and/or Early Isoniazid Prophylaxis Against Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected Adults (TEMPRANO ANRS) trial (n&#8197;=&#8197;2056)[[30]]&mdash;and 3 large fair-quality cohort studies, ranging in sample size from 3532 to 55,826 (total n&#8197;=&#8197;63,478),[[31-33]] that provided evidence on the benefits of early initiation of ART.</p>\r\n<p>The HPTN 052 trial randomly assigned participants to initiation of ART at CD4 cell counts of 350/mL<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;to 550/mL<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;or delayed initiation at CD4 cell counts of 250/mL<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;or less.[[27]] At a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, initiation of ART at higher CD4 counts was associated with decreased risk of AIDS-related events (4.5% vs 7.0%; relative risk [RR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.44-0.95]). Effects on other outcomes (including all-cause mortality; AIDS-related mortality; and a composite outcome including death, serious AIDS-related events, and serious non&ndash;AIDS-related events, such as bacterial infection or cancer) favored early initiation of ART but were not statistically significant.[[28]] The START trial found decreased risk of a composite end point of all-cause mortality, serious AIDS-related events, and serious non&ndash;AIDS-related events,[[29]] and the TEMPRANO ANRS trial found decreased risk of a composite end point of all-cause mortality, progression to AIDS, AIDS-defining cancer, and non&ndash;AIDS-defining invasive bacterial disease[[30]] in participants treated with immediate ART at CD4 cell counts greater than 500/mL<sup>3</sup>, compared with delayed treatment at lower CD4 counts.</p>\r\n<p>The 3 cohort studies[[31-33]] also provide evidence of benefit to early initiation of ART. Seven-year follow-up from the HIV Cohorts Analyzed Using Structural Approaches to Longitudinal (HIV CAUSAL) Collaboration showed that ART initiation at CD4 cell counts greater than 500/mL<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality and a composite end point of progression to AIDS or death compared with initiation at CD4 cell counts less than 350/mL<sup>3</sup>.[[31]] A second cohort study from Canada found that initiation of ART at CD4 cell counts greater than 500/mL<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;was associated with lower probability of mortality and AIDS-related morbidity than initiation at CD4 cell counts less than 500/mL<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;or less than 350/mL<sup>3</sup>.[[32]] Last, a US-based cohort study found that compared with initiation of ART within 6 months of CD4 cell counts decreasing to less than 500/mL<sup>3</sup>, there were greater risks of 10-year all-cause mortality associated with ART initiation within 6 months of CD4 cell counts decreasing to less than 350/mL<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;(RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.00-1.16]) or 200/mL<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;(RR, 1.25&nbsp;[95% CI, 1.08-1.44]).[[33]]</p>\r\n<p>Early initiation of ART and viral suppression has also been shown to decrease risk of HIV transmission.[[27]] Longer-term follow-up from the HPTN 052 trial showed that early ART initiation is associated with a reduction in risk of HIV transmission to uninfected partners (RR for virologically linked transmission, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.22]),[[34]] and 3 observational studies (Partners of People on ART&mdash;A New Evaluation of the Risks [PARTNER],[[35]] PARTNER2,[[36]] and Opposites Attract[[37]]) found no cases of HIV transmission among serodiscordant couples when the partner living with HIV was treated with ART and had viral suppression, during 1238, 1593, and 232.2&nbsp;couple-years of follow-up, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>In its discussions about the age range for routine screening, the USPSTF considered the evidence on the age-stratified incidence of HIV infection and data on the prevalence of sexual activity in youth. Data from the CDC 2017 HIV Surveillance Report show a significant increase in HIV diagnoses in the United States starting at age 15 years (compared with ages 13-14 years).[[2]] In addition, 52% of youth in grades 9 through 12 reported engaging in sexual contact in the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance survey,[[38]] and in earlier survey data, approximately one-third of youth reported engaging in sexual intercourse before age 16 years.[[39]] CDC surveillance data also show a significant decrease in HIV diagnoses among adults 65 years and older.[[2]]</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that compared rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection between pregnant women screened and not screened for HIV infection. The USPSTF found several cohort studies and RCTs that provided evidence on the effectiveness of ART in decreasing rates of mother-to child transmission of HIV infection in pregnant women living with HIV.[[24,25]] The cohort studies, all conducted in North America, Europe, or Israel, reported rates of mother-to-child transmission of less than 1.0% to 2.8% among women treated with 3 antiretroviral drugs, compared with 9.1% to as much as 67% in 1 small cohort study among untreated women.[[24,25]] The RCTs were conducted in Africa or India (ie, settings with a lower United Nations Human Development Index than the United States) and compared the effects of a heterogeneous group of prenatal, peripartum, and postpartum ART interventions of varying durations on rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection. Across all studies (both the cohort studies and RCTs), later initiation of ART during pregnancy or treatment with fewer than 3 antiretroviral drugs was associated with greater risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.[[24,25]]</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Longer-term use of individual antiretroviral drugs and different ART regimens may be associated with several harms. The USPSTF reviewed several studies that reported on the long-term cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, hepatic, renal, or bone (fracture) harms associated with the use of various antiretroviral drugs and ART regimens.[[22,23]]</p>\r\n<p>Two good-quality RCTs (duration, 2.8-5 years) found no differences in risk of serious cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events between different ART regimens.[[40,41]] Findings on the cardiovascular harms of the drug abacavir are mixed. A meta-analysis of 26 trials found no association between abacavir use and risk of myocardial infarction,[[42]] but 2 cohort studies found that abacavir was associated with increased risk (RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.72-2.29] and odds ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.26-1.79]).[[43,44]]</p>\r\n<p>The drug efavirenz has been linked to neuropsychiatric adverse events, including depression and suicidal ideation.[[45]] A systematic review (n&#8197;=&#8197;8466; mean duration, 78 weeks) reported rates of neuropsychiatric adverse events among participants taking efavirenz; 29.6% (95% CI, 21.9%-37.3%) experienced events of any grade, 6.1% (95% CI, 4.3%-7.9%) experienced severe neuropsychiatric adverse events, 3.3% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.3%) had depression, and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.1%) had suicidal ideation.[[46]] However, an analysis of the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study, a large (n &gt;49,000) international study of 11 prospective cohorts from Europe, Australia, and the United States, found no association between use of efavirenz and death from suicide,[[47]] and an analysis of a large (n&#8197;=&#8197;19,983) US administrative cohort found no association between initiation of efavirenz and increased risk of suicidal ideation.[[48]]</p>\r\n<p>An analysis of the D:A:D cohorts found that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (relative rate, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.11-1.93]) and fosamprenavir (relative rate, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.01-2.15]) were associated with increased risk of end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma, independent of viral hepatitis status, and that emtricitabine was associated with decreased risk of these outcomes (relative rate, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-0.83]).[[49]] However, the absolute risk of ART-related liver deaths in the D:A:D cohorts was low (0.04 deaths per 1000 person-years).[[50]] Another D:A:D analysis found an association between use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (rate ratio, 1.14 cases per year of exposure [95% CI, 1.10-1.19]) or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (rate ratio, 1.20 cases per year of exposure [95% CI, 1.13 to 1.26]) and increased risk of chronic kidney disease.[[51]] A second observational study also found that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with an increased risk of renal adverse events,[[52]] and a third observational study found that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with kidney dysfunction, which was relatively mild and tended to be stable over several years.[[53]]</p>\r\n<p>A cohort study found that ever use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with increased risk of fracture compared with nonuse (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.40&nbsp;[95% CI, 1.05-1.70]) after follow-up of more than 86&#8197;000 person-years. However, there was no difference in risk of fracture based on cumulative duration of use (adjusted incidence rate ratio per 5 years of exposure, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.94-1.25]).[[54]]</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed several studies that assessed the harms of ART during pregnancy.[[24,25]] One fair-quality RCT and 7 cohort studies found that antenatal ART was associated with increased risk of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) compared with no treatment or zidovudine monotherapy.[[55-62]] No clear associations were found between ART and overall birth defects, low birth weight, small size for gestational age, stillbirth, or neonatal death.[[24,25]] There were mixed findings on cardiovascular congenital anomalies.[[24,25]] Two studies of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants and children found that in utero exposure to ART was not associated with lower scores on Wechsler intelligence and achievement tests in children aged 7 to 13 years[[63]] and may be associated with less neurodevelopmental impairment[[64]] compared with no in utero exposure to ART.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence on maternal harms associated with ART during pregnancy is limited. Three older studies suggest that ART (especially with a protease inhibitor) may be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.[[65-67]] One RCT found no difference in risk of anemia between combination ART (zidovudine, lamivudine, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) starting at 28 to 36 weeks of gestation vs zidovudine monotherapy starting at 34 to 36 weeks of gestation until onset of labor, followed by zidovudine and a single dose of nevirapine at the onset of labor.[[68]] Another RCT found that treatment with zidovudine-based ART resulted in increased risk of maternal adverse events vs zidovudine monotherapy (21% vs 17%;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&#8197;=&#8197;0.008) and increased risk of abnormalities in blood chemistry values (5.8% vs 1.3%;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&#8197;&lt;&#8197;0.001), primarily elevated alanine aminotransferase levels.[[55]]</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that early detection and treatment of HIV infection would result in substantial benefits. Screening for HIV infection in all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years, persons at increased risk of infection, and pregnant persons would allow for earlier and expanded detection of HIV infection, thus resulting in earlier medical and behavioral interventions and treatment.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that early initiation of ART for HIV infection, regardless of CD4 cell count, improves clinical outcomes and reduces the risk of sexual transmission. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of early detection and treatment of HIV infection are small, and the clinical benefits of ART substantially outweigh the potential risks of treatment in persons living with HIV. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that screening for HIV infection in pregnant women confers substantial clinical benefits for both the mother and infant, with adequate evidence that the potential harms are small.</p>\r\n<p>On the basis of these findings, the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that early detection and treatment of HIV infection results in substantial net benefit.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Diagnosis and initiation of treatment of HIV infection at the earliest stage possible is associated with improved health outcomes. Screening with highly accurate tests allows for diagnosis in the relatively long preclinical phase of HIV infection. Early treatment with ART has been shown to effectively suppress viral load and decrease the risk of AIDS-related events, serious non&ndash;AIDS-related events, and death in persons living with HIV infection. Effective treatment also decreases risk of sexual transmission of HIV by suppressing viral load in infected persons. Diagnosis and effective treatment in pregnant persons living with HIV decreases the risk of mother-to-child transmission by suppressing viral load and allowing for implementation of other prevention strategies (ie, appropriate antiretroviral treatment of the newborn and counseling about avoidance of breastfeeding).</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 20 through December 26, 2018. In response to public comment, the USPSTF added information and clarified language regarding assessment of risk, high-prevalence HIV settings, and persons who may be at increased risk and warrant rescreening, as well as the importance of linkage to care after an HIV diagnosis. The USPSTF also clarified that persons not at increased risk may not need rescreening. The USPSTF clarified language describing the epidemiology of HIV and provided additional details on the HPTN 052 study. The USPSTF also added information about the data it considered in its discussions about the age at which to start and end routine screening.</p>",

In addition, there is evidence that over time, perinatal transmission has decreased among women and infants enrolled in case management, providing an overall substantial health benefit. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that screening for HBV infection in pregnant women provides substantial benefit.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 8, 2019, to February 4, 2019. A majority of the comments wanted more information about treatment with antiviral therapy. In response, the USPSTF added information about emerging evidence that treatment with antiviral therapy works and that more research is needed in the Clinical Considerations and Research Needs and Gaps sections.</p>",

      "rationale": "<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (referred to hereafter as pancreatic cancer) is an uncommon cancer with an age-adjusted annual incidence of 12.9 cases per 100,000 person-years. However, the death rate is 11.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years because the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is poor.[[1]] Although its incidence is low, pancreatic cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program from 2009 to 2015, the overall 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 9.3%, and survival rates vary depending on the stage at which it is diagnosed. The 5-year survival rate for localized pancreatic cancer is 37.4%; when regional disease is present, the 5-year survival rate is 12.4%, and when distant metastatic disease is present, the 5-year survival rate is 2.9%.[[1]] Surgical intervention at an early stage is the treatment most likely to improve chances of survival; however, most cases of pancreatic cancer are detected at an advanced stage,1 when surgical resection is not likely to be beneficial. Because of the increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer, along with improvements in early detection and treatment of other types of cancer, it is estimated that pancreatic cancer may soon become the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States.[[2]]</p>\r\n<p>In 2019, an estimated 56,770 persons will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 45,750 persons will die of the disease.[[1]] About 85% to 90% of persons diagnosed with pancreatic cancer do not have known familial risk or genetic syndromes, 5% to 10% of persons have familial risk, and 3% to 5% of cases are due to inherited genetic cancer syndromes (such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Familial pancreatic cancer is defined as a kindred with at least 2 affected first-degree relatives; a person&rsquo;s degree of familial risk depends on the number of affected relatives.[[3-5]]</p>\r\n<h3>Reaffirmation Process</h3>\r\n<p>In 2004, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults and issued a D recommendation. The USPSTF decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation. The USPSTF uses the reaffirmation process for existing A or D grade recommendations for which only a very high level of evidence would justify a change in the grade of the recommendation. In its deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF considers whether the new evidence is of sufficient strength and quality to change its previous conclusions about the evidence.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on the accuracy of imaging-based screening tests (computed tomography [CT] scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS]) for detecting pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence that screening for pancreatic cancer or treatment of screen-detected pancreatic cancer improves disease-specific morbidity or mortality, or all-cause mortality. Based on the low incidence of pancreatic cancer in the general population, the uncertain accuracy of current candidate screening tests, and the poor prognosis for pancreatic cancer even when treated at an early stage, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults as no greater than small. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate indirect evidence to bound the magnitude of the harms of screening for pancreatic cancer and treatment of screen-detected pancreatic cancer as at least moderate, based on potential harms from false-positive results and the harms of treatment.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Using a reaffirmation deliberation process, the USPSTF concludes that there is no new evidence that warrants a change in the prior D recommendation and reaffirms its previous conclusion that the potential benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults do not outweigh the potential harms.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults not known to be at high risk of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, this recommendation does not apply to persons at high risk of pancreatic cancer due to an inherited genetic syndrome (eg, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis) or due to a history of familial pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Persons with certain inherited genetic syndromes or a history of familial pancreatic cancer are at high risk of pancreatic cancer. This recommendation does not apply to these high-risk populations.</p>\r\n<p>Other factors such as new-onset diabetes, preexisting diabetes, older age, cigarette smoking, obesity, or a history of chronic pancreatitis increase risk to a lesser degree. The USPSTF considers asymptomatic persons who have these other risk factors part of the general population, and they are included in this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF does not recommend screening for pancreatic cancer in the general population using any method. Imaging-based methods, such as the CT scan, MRI, and EUS, have been studied as screening tests in trials of screening persons at high risk of pancreatic cancer due to inherited genetic syndromes or familial pancreatic cancer. There currently are no accurate, validated biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer.[[6-11]]</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy [known as the Whipple procedure] or total or distal pancreatectomy) is the generally recommended treatment for pancreatic cancer deemed to be resectable at the time of diagnosis. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended, depending on the stage of cancer and other factors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Research is needed to develop effective screening tests with high sensitivity and high specificity for pancreatic cancer and, ideally, high-grade precursor lesions. Research is needed to better understand the prevalence and natural history of precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer, including the likelihood of progression of precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Studies investigating the benefits and harms of screening for pancreatic cancer in persons at high risk because of a history of familial pancreatic cancer and inherited genetic syndromes are an active area of research. Continued research in this area is needed to identify effective screening strategies and to determine the benefits (ie, improved clinical outcomes) and harms of screening for pancreatic cancer in this population. If a net benefit of screening is found in high-risk persons, studies of screening in persons who may be at increased risk (eg, adults with new-onset diabetes) may be warranted. Research on improved risk stratification may also help advance the field of pancreatic cancer screening.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, pancreatectomy carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, and the prognosis for more advanced pancreatic cancer, which is not amenable to surgery, is poor. Research on better treatments for all stages of pancreatic cancer to improve long-term survival and decrease the harms of treatment is needed.</p>",
      "other": "<p>Recommendation of Others</p>\r\n<p><span>No organization currently recommends screening for pancreatic cancer in the general population of asymptomatic adults. The American College of Gastroenterology conditionally recommends surveillance for pancreatic cancer in certain high-risk persons (eg, those with known genetic syndromes associated with pancreatic cancer and those from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds who have an affected first-degree relative) and suggests that surveillance should be performed in experienced centers, ideally under research conditions.[[38]]</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Reaffirmation of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2004 recommendation statement against screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults.[[37]] In 2004, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for pancreatic cancer and concluded that the harms of screening for pancreatic cancer exceed any potential benefits. For the current recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review[[12,13]] to look for new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening. The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that would change its recommendation and therefore reaffirms its recommendation against screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults.</span></p>",
      "discussion": "<h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Pancreatic cancer is uncommon, with an estimated incidence of 12.9 cases per 100,000 person-years. It has a poor prognosis, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 9.3%.[[1]] Surgical intervention at an early stage is the treatment most likely to improve chances of survival; however, most cases of pancreatic cancer are detected at an advanced stage,1 when surgery is not likely to improve the survival rate. In 2019, an estimated 56&#8197;770 persons will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and 45,750 persons will die of it, making it the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States.[[1]]</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2004 recommendation on screening for pancreatic cancer, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review on the benefits and harms of screening for pancreatic cancer, the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pancreatic cancer, and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic cancer.[[12,13]] The USPSTF considered studies of screening in persons at high risk of pancreatic cancer due to familial history to determine whether this evidence might help inform its recommendation on screening for pancreatic cancer in the general population.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that reported on the sensitivity or specificity of CT scan, MRI, or EUS as screening tests for pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 13 cohort studies of screening for pancreatic cancer, mostly in persons at high familial risk, using CT scan, MRI, or EUS (n&#8197;=&#8197;1317) that reported on the yield of screening.[[14-26]] One study also included screening in a group of 161 participants who did not have known familial or genetic risks and detected no cases of pancreatic cancer in this group.[[22]] Among high-risk participants in all studies, a total of 18 cases of pancreatic cancer were found across all rounds of screening, for a yield of 15.6 cases per 1000 persons.[[12,13]] The applicability of these data to persons not at high risk of pancreatic cancer is uncertain, and the yield of screening in a population with a lower incidence of pancreatic cancer is likely to be much lower. Another important consideration is that any screening test used in a population with a lower incidence of pancreatic cancer would potentially have a lower positive predictive value and a higher rate of false-positive results.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer or on the benefits of treatment of screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic cancer in the general population.</p>\r\n<p>In the 13 cohort studies of screening in persons at high familial risk, a total of 57 screened patients underwent pancreatic surgery. Of the 57 patients undergoing surgery, 14 were found to have pancreatic cancer, 38 had precursor lesions (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or both), and 5 had neuroendocrine tumors, liver hyperplasia, or a benign serous cystadenoma.[[12]] Because the risk of progression of precursor lesions (particularly low-grade lesions) to invasive cancer is not clear, the balance of the potential benefits or harms of detecting and undergoing pancreatic surgery to remove such lesions is unknown. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is common, and most cases do not progress to cancer. In 2 studies, 26% to 54% of pancreata removed at surgery for reasons other than pancreatic cancer contained such lesions.[[27,28]] Another retrospective study, describing the experience at 3 US cancer centers with surgical resection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms,[[29]] found that the International Consensus Guidelines criteria for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas30 had high sensitivity (98.4%) but low specificity (14.8%) to predict high-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer. These data suggest the possibility that screening in the general population might lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p>\r\n<p>In the screening studies of high-risk persons, a total of 18 cases of pancreatic cancer were detected. As noted above, 14 of these cases were confirmed by surgery. The remaining 4 cases were detected with advanced-stage nonresectable disease. Twelve of the cases (66.7%) were detected at stage I or II or were classified as &ldquo;resectable.&rdquo;[[12,13]]&nbsp;Of the 18 detected cases of pancreatic cancer, longer-term follow-up was reported for only 10. Among those 10 cases, 5 persons were alive at 12 to 63 months of follow-up, 2 of whom were reported to have distant metastases.[[12]]&nbsp;These data are limited by incomplete reporting of follow-up for detected cases and by the small number of cases. The USPSTF did not find studies that compared health outcomes for screened and unscreened populations to determine the effectiveness of screening. In addition, the applicability of these results to a population not at high risk is uncertain.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 10 cohort studies of screening for pancreatic cancer in high-risk persons to assess the potential harms of screening and treatment. In 2 studies (n&#8197;=&#8197;271) that assessed the psychosocial harms of screening, the majority of participants reported normal levels of distress or worry at all time points.[[31,32]] One study reported no change in levels of perceived pancreatic cancer risk, worry, and general distress at baseline and 3 months after screening,[[31]] while a second study reported Cancer Worry Scale scores that decreased over time (compared with baseline scores).[[32]]</p>\r\n<p>Eight studies reported on procedure-related harms of screening.[[14,15,17-22]] In 1 study of 216 persons who underwent EUS, 55 (25.5%) reported mild postprocedure pain, and 13 (6.0%) reported adverse events related to anesthesia.[[22]] Of 150 persons in 2 studies who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography as a diagnostic test, 15 (10.0%) developed acute pancreatitis, 9 of whom required hospitalization.[[21,22]] The remaining 6 studies identified no harms related to screening.[[14,15,17-20]] The prevalence of incidental findings was not consistently reported in the available studies.</p>\r\n<p>Six studies reported on the harms of surgery (n&#8197;=&#8197;32 persons receiving surgery).[[14,17,18,20,22,33]] One study reported a stricture to the hepaticojejunal anastomosis in 1 patient 11 months after surgery and unspecified postoperative complications in another patient.[[14]] In another study, 2 cases of postoperative fistula and 3 cases of diabetes were reported.[[17]] Four studies reported no harms.[[18,20,22,33]]</p>\r\n<p>Pancreatectomy carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, and additional data on the harms of surgery are available from studies not specifically conducted in screen-detected persons. A German study of 428 patients undergoing pancreatectomy (primarily pancreaticoduodenectomy) reported a 33.6% rate of any complication.[[34]] One 2003 US study reported a 4.6% rate of perioperative mortality after pancreatectomy for neoplastic disease,[[35]] and another US study of 21,482 pancreatectomies performed between 2007 and 2010 found a 3.7% 30-day mortality rate.[[36]]</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered the evidence using a reaffirmation process and found no new evidence on the benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of the harms of screening for pancreatic cancer and treatment of screen-detected pancreatic cancer can be bounded as at least moderate. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that the potential benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults do not outweigh the potential harms.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 5 through March 4, 2019. In response to public comment, the USPSTF added information on survival rates for pancreatic cancer by stage. The USPSTF added information about the consensus guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, and the accuracy (ie, sensitivity and specificity) of those guidelines in predicting the presence of pancreatic cancer or high-grade dysplasia. The USPSTF also added data on longer-term follow-up of screening studies in persons at high familial risk of pancreatic cancer. A few comments requested that the USPSTF make a recommendation on screening in persons with a history of familial pancreatic cancer or persons with an inherited genetic syndrome known to be associated with high risk of pancreatic cancer. In response, the USPSTF wants to clarify that these groups are outside the scope of this recommendation and that this recommendation does not apply to these persons.</p>",

Risk for clinically significant&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations can be further evaluated with genetic counseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of selected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.

These tools can be used by primary care clinicians to guide referrals to genetic counseling.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has previously established that there is adequate evidence that current genetic tests can accurately detect known&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2mutations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Screening, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing are moderate in women whose family history is associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;genes.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing are small to none in women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;genes.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms associated with risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to moderate.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of risk assessment for increased risk of&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations, testing for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations, and use of risk-reducing interventions outweighs the harms in women whose family or personal history is associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;genes.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of risk assessment for increased risk of&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations, testing for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations, and use of risk-reducing interventions outweigh the benefits in women whose family or personal history is not associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;genes.</p>",
      "clinical": "<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to women who are asymptomatic for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA-related cancer and have unknown&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA&nbsp;mutation status. It includes women who have never been diagnosed with&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA-related cancer, as well as those with a previous breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer diagnosis who have completed treatment and are considered cancer free but have not been previously tested. While this recommendation applies to women, the net benefit estimates are driven by biological sex (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity. Persons should consider their sex at birth to determine which recommendation best applies to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Mutations in the&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;genes cluster in families, showing an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in either the mother&rsquo;s or father&rsquo;s family. When taking medical and family history information from patients, primary care clinicians should ask about specific types of cancer, primary cancer sites, which family members were affected, and whether relatives had multiple types of primary cancer. Clinicians should also inquire about the age at diagnosis, age at death, and sex of affected family members, both immediate (ie, parents and siblings) as well as more distant (ie, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins).</p>\r\n<p>For women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or have a personal history of these types of cancer, primary care clinicians may use appropriate brief familial risk assessment tools to determine the need for in-depth genetic counseling. Tools evaluated by the USPSTF include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#tab1\">Table 1</a>), Manchester Scoring System (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#tab2\">Table 2</a>), Referral Screening Tool (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#tab3\">Table 3</a>), Pedigree Assessment Tool (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#tab4\">Table 4</a>),&nbsp;7-Question Family History Screening Tool (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#tab5\">Table 5</a>), International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (Tyrer-Cuzick) (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#tab6\">Table 6</a>), and brief versions of BRCAPRO. Each of these tools has been validated and accurately estimate the likelihood of carrying a harmful&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutation.

These include breast cancer diagnosis before age 50 years, bilateral breast cancer, presence of both breast and ovarian cancer in one individual, male family members with breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer in the family, 1 or more family members with 2 primary types of&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA-related cancer (such as ovarian cancer), and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has advantages and limitations and found insufficient evidence to recommend one over another.</p>\r\n<h3>Genetic Counseling</h3>\r\n<p>The process of genetic counseling includes detailed kindred analysis and risk assessment for potentially harmful&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations. It also includes identification of candidates for testing, patient education, discussion of the benefits and harms of genetic testing, interpretation of results after testing, and discussion of management options. Genetic counseling about&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutation testing should be performed by trained health professionals, including suitably trained primary care clinicians. Several professional organizations describe the skills and training necessary to provide comprehensive genetic counseling.</p>\r\n<h3>Genetic Testing</h3>\r\n<p>Testing for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations should be performed only when an individual has personal or family history that suggests an inherited cancer susceptibility, when an individual is willing to talk with a health professional who is suitably trained to provide genetic counseling and interpret test results, and when test results will aid in decision-making. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutation testing begin with a relative with known&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA-related cancer, including male relatives, to determine if a clinically significant mutation is detected in the family before testing individuals without cancer.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#citation29\">29</a></sup>&nbsp;If an affected family member with a&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA-related cancer is not available, then the relative with the highest probability of mutation should be tested. The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from families with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations are more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for these specific mutations. Because risk assessment is primarily based on family history, it is unclear how women with a limited or unknown family history should be assessed for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutation risk and potential referral to counseling or genetic testing.</p>\r\n<p>Tests for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations are highly sensitive and specific for known mutations. The availability of testing options has changed since the 2013 US Supreme Court ruling that determined human genes are not patentable (&lt; i&gt;Association for Molecular Pathology et al v Myriad Genetics Inc et al).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#citation30\">30</a></sup>&nbsp;Previously,&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutation testing in the United States was mainly conducted by 1 laboratory. Since the ruling, the number of testing options has significantly increased, with more than 80 multigene panels that include&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2, as well as tests marketed directly to consumers.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#citation31\">31</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, which were updated in 2015, recommend new standard terminology for reporting&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations identified by genetic tests. These include a 5-tier terminology system using the terms &ldquo;pathogenic,&rdquo; &ldquo;likely pathogenic,&rdquo; &ldquo;uncertain significance,&rdquo; &ldquo;likely benign,&rdquo; and &ldquo;benign.&rdquo;<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#citation32\">32</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Management of increased cancer risk related to&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations is beyond the scope of this Recommendation Statement. In general, care for women with harmful&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations consists of a variety of interventions to lower future cancer risk. This includes intensive screening, risk-reducing medications, and risk-reducing mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetics Services Directory provides a list of professionals who offer services related to cancer genetics, including cancer risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#citation33\">33</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><sup>Other Considerations</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Research on risk assessment and testing for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations has focused on short-term outcomes for highly selected women in referral centers. To determine the best approaches for population-based risk assessment and testing, more research is needed about mutation prevalence and effects on the general population as well as ethnicities or ancestries associated with&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations. Because risk assessment is primarily based on family history, more research is needed to better understand how women with an unknown family history should be assessed for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutation risk. Additional studies are needed, including comparative effectiveness trials, of approaches to risk screening and strategies to improve access to genetic counseling, as well as&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;testing for high-risk individuals.</p>\r\n<p>It would be helpful to understand which methods of delivery of genetic counseling are most effective, including those that can increase access to genetic counseling in rural or other settings with limited access. Trials comparing types of clinicians and protocols could address these questions. The consequences of genetic testing for individuals and their relatives require more study. Well-designed investigations using standardized measures and diverse study populations are needed.</p>\r\n<p>An expanded database or registry of patients receiving genetic counseling for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility or who are tested for&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1/2&nbsp;mutations would provide useful information about predictors of cancer and response to interventions.

For women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;genes, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to none.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to moderate.</p>\r\n<p>For women whose family history is associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;genes, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit outweighs the harm of risk assessment and referral to genetic counseling for consideration of testing, detection, and intervention is moderate. For women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;genes, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of risk assessment and referral to genetic counseling for consideration of testing, detection, and intervention outweigh the benefits.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>BRCA1</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>&nbsp;genes are tumor suppressor genes. Harmful mutations of these genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of&nbsp;<em>BRCA</em>-related cancer are greatly increased in patients who have inherited potentially harmful&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;mutations. Genetic testing may identify these mutations. Several options are available to reduce cancer risk in patients found to be mutation carriers.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this Recommendation Statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 19 through March 18, 2019. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified language regarding risk assessment and included additional information on the risk assessment tools referenced in the recommendation. It also incorporated language clarifying that the recommendation includes women with a personal history of&nbsp;<em>BRCA</em>-related cancer who have completed treatment and are considered cured.</p>\r\n<p>Comments requested that the population under consideration be expanded to include other&nbsp;<em>BRCA</em>-associated cancers such as pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer, as well as men with breast or prostate cancer. The USPSTF recognizes the association of&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;mutations with cancers such as pancreatic, prostate, and melanoma. However, the scope of the recommendation is limited to the prevention of breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancer because the net benefit demonstrated was in the prevention of these cancers. The USPSTF did not review evidence on the benefits or harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing in men.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments requested changes to the recommendation related to newer genetic testing options. This includes the use of multigene panels, expanding the recommendation to include other gene mutations linked to increased risk of cancer (eg,&nbsp;<em>TP53, ATM, PALB2</em>), and the use of direct-to-consumer testing. The USPSTF acknowledges that there is increasing access to multigene panels; however, the clinical significance of identifying pathogenic variants in multigene panels requires further investigation. The evidence is currently limited on other moderate penetrance genes, given their relatively low incidence in the population. The USPSTF&rsquo;s recommendation focuses on&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>mutations because they are more prevalent and the findings are clinically actionable. The USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms associated with the use of direct-to-consumer testing. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend that multigene testing be offered in the context of professional genetic expertise for pretest and posttest.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing1#citation29\">29</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF added language emphasizing that the net benefit relies on genetic counseling to accompany testing results, including results from direct-to-consumer testing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>",

However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer over time. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Benefits of Risk-Reducing Medications</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor (ER)&ndash;positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#tab\">Table</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Both tamoxifen and raloxifene can reduce risk of some types of skeletal fractures, independent from the risk of breast cancer.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Risk-Reducing Medications</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene are associated with small to moderate harms. Tamoxifen and raloxifene increase risk for venous thromboembolic events (VTEs); tamoxifen increases risk more than raloxifene (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#tab\">Table</a>), and the potential for harms are greater in older women than in younger women. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that tamoxifen, but not raloxifene, increases risk for endometrial cancer in women with a uterus. Tamoxifen also increases risk of cataracts. Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) are a common adverse effect of both medications.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of aromatase inhibitors are also small to moderate. These harms include vasomotor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and possible cardiovascular events, such as stroke. Aromatase inhibitors do not reduce, and may even increase, risk of fractures.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit from taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk of invasive breast cancer in women at increased risk.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential harms of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk of breast cancer outweigh the potential benefits in women not at increased risk for the disease.</p>\r\n<p>Clinicians should discuss the limitations of current clinical risk assessment tools for predicting an individual&rsquo;s future risk of breast cancer when discussing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medications with women.</p>",

Some examples of combinations of multiple risk factors in women at increased risk include (but are not limited to) age 65 years or older with 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer; 45 years or older with more than 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer or 1 first-degree relative who developed breast cancer before age 50 years; 40 years or older with a first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer; presence of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ on a prior biopsy.</p>\r\n<p>Women with documented pathogenic mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 genes (<em>BRCA1/2</em>) and women with a history of chest radiation therapy (such as for treatment of childhood or adolescent Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma) are at especially high risk for breast cancer. The cumulative absolute risk of developing breast cancer in a woman who received chest radiation at age 25 years increases from an estimated 1.4% at age 35 years to an estimated 29% by age 55 years,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;although this may vary by treatment regimen. Women who carry a&nbsp;<em>BRCA1</em>&nbsp;mutation have a cumulative risk for breast cancer of 72% by age 80 years; women who carry a&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>mutation have a 69% cumulative risk<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;(compared with a 12% lifetime risk in the general population<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation9\">9</a></sup>). Women who carry the&nbsp;<em>BRCA1</em>mutation tend to develop estrogen receptor (ER)&ndash;negative breast cancer,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;while women who carry the&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>&nbsp;mutation tend to develop ER-positive breast cancer. However, the USPSTF was not able to find sufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medications in women with&nbsp;<em>BRCA1/2</em>&nbsp;gene mutations or women with a history of chest radiation, and the comprehensive management of these risk factors is beyond the scope of this Recommendation Statement. Further information on comprehensive management strategies, including risk-reducing medications, for women with these conditions is available from other organizations.</p>\r\n<p>Women not at increased risk for breast cancer, such as women younger than 60 years with no additional risk factors for breast cancer, or women with a low 5-year risk of breast cancer should not be routinely offered medications to reduce risk of breast cancer, since the risk of harms from these medications likely outweighs their potential benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Although evidence on the best interval at which to reassess risk and indications for risk-reducing medications is not available, a pragmatic approach would be to repeat risk assessment when there is a significant change in breast cancer risk factors, for instance when a family member is diagnosed with breast cancer or when there is a new diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ on breast biopsy.</p>\r\n<p>When considering prescribing breast cancer risk-reducing medications, potential benefit of risk reduction of breast cancer must be balanced against the potential harms of adverse medication effects. See below for more information on potential harms from risk-reducing medications.</p>\r\n<h3>Risk-Reducing Medications</h3>\r\n<p>A systematic review of trials conducted for the USPSTF found that compared with placebo, tamoxifen reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 7 events per 1000 women over 5 years (95% CI, 4-12), and raloxifene reduced incidence by 9 events (95% CI, 3-15) per 1000 women over 5 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Given that the study participants in tamoxifen vs placebo and raloxifene vs placebo trials differed with respect to breast cancer risk and age, direct comparisons of effectiveness between tamoxifen and raloxifene cannot be made based on these placebo-controlled trials. However, the large Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, which directly compared tamoxifen with raloxifene, found that tamoxifen reduced breast cancer risk more than raloxifene after long-term follow-up<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#tab\">Table</a>). For women with a predicted 5-year breast cancer risk of 3% or greater, the absolute benefits are likely even higher. Tamoxifen and raloxifene have been found to reduce risk for nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, respectively.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;However, use of tamoxifen and raloxifene is also associated with increased risk for VTEs and vasomotor symptoms. Tamoxifen also increases the risk for endometrial cancer and cataracts. These risks are increased in older women, although women who have had a hysterectomy are not at risk for endometrial cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Aromatase inhibitors were found to reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 16 events per 1000 women over 5 years (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#tab\">Table</a>).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;As with tamoxifen and raloxifene, these absolute benefits are likely even higher for women with a predicted breast cancer risk of 3% or greater. Harms of aromatase inhibitors include vasomotor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and musculoskeletal pain. Data on harms of aromatase inhibitors for the primary risk reduction of breast cancer are limited, especially long-term harms. A trend toward increased cardiovascular events (such as transient ischemic attack and cerebrovascular accident) has been observed in some aromatase inhibitor trials for treatment of women with early-stage breast cancer (or DCIS).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation3\">3</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation11\">11</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;Younger women with no risk factors for cardiovascular disease are less likely to have a cardiovascular event with aromatase inhibitor treatment. Aromatase inhibitors do not reduce, and may even increase, risk of fractures.</p>\r\n<p>Tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors all reduce primary breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Use of raloxifene and aromatase inhibitors is indicated only in postmenopausal women; only tamoxifen is indicated for risk-reduction of primary breast cancer in premenopausal women.</p>\r\n<h3>Duration of Medication Use and Persistence of Effects</h3>\r\n<p>In trials, participants typically used risk-reducing medications for 3 to 5 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Benefits of tamoxifen have been found to persist up to 8 years beyond discontinuation,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation13\">13</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;whereas risk for VTEs and endometrial cancer return to baseline after discontinuation of tamoxifen.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation15\">15</a></sup>Data on similarly long-term persistence of effects are not available for raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for breast cancer<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation16\">16</a></sup>&nbsp;and for risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for&nbsp;<em>BRCA</em>&nbsp;genetic mutations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;The NCI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide information about potential ways to reduce risk of cancer, including lifestyle and diet changes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation18\">18</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation19\">19</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF does not endorse any particular risk prediction tool. However, the NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium Risk Calculator<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;are based on models tested in US populations and are publicly available for clinicians and patients to use as part of the process of shared, informed decision-making about taking risk-reducing medications for breast cancer. Both tools have been calibrated in US populations, but their discriminatory accuracy of predicting which women will develop breast cancer may be more limited and there is no single cutoff for defining increased risk for all women.</p>",
      "other": "<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Prescribing risk-reducing medications for breast cancer is an uncommon practice among primary care clinicians. Based on limited survey data, 10% to 30% (depending on medication type) of primary care clinicians report ever prescribing risk-reducing medications for primary prevention of breast cancer, and most have only done so a few times.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation21\">21-23</a></sup>&nbsp;The reported use of risk-reducing medications among women is also relatively low; 1 meta-analysis of 26 studies found that overall, 16.3% of women at increased risk for breast cancer used risk-reducing medications.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation24\">24</a></sup>&nbsp;Although only exploratory, a number of studies have suggested that even women who are well informed about the risks and benefits have relatively little interest in taking risk-reducing medications for breast cancer and are primarily concerned with potential harms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation25\">25-29</a></sup>&nbsp;When considering prescribing risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, clinicians should discuss each woman&rsquo;s personal values and preferences with respect to breast cancer risk reduction, in addition to what is known about her personal risk for breast cancer and the potential benefits and harms of medications.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>More research is needed to better identify which individual women at increased risk for breast cancer could best benefit from risk-reducing medications. In particular, studies are needed that evaluate how medications may reduce breast cancer risk in women who are carriers of pathogenic&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA1&nbsp;or&nbsp;&lt; i&gt;BRCA2&nbsp;mutations. Additionally, given the higher breast cancer mortality rates in African American women, studies that include sufficient numbers of African American women are needed to better understand how medications may reduce risk in these women. Although currently available risk assessment tools can identify the number of cases of breast cancer expected to arise in a given population, better tools for predicting breast cancer risk in individual women are needed. Additionally, longer-term follow-up is needed for studies of raloxifene and aromatase inhibitors to better understand the persistence of both breast cancer risk reduction effects and potential harms from the medications. Longer-term data on harms of aromatase inhibitors for the risk reduction of primary breast cancer are also needed. This information could help clinicians weigh the benefits and harms of individual medications with their patients.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendations is consistent with the 2013 USPSTF recommendation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-medications-for-risk-reduction1#citation88\">88</a></sup>&nbsp;As before, the USPSTF recommends offering risk-reducing medications to women at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects (B recommendation) and recommends against routine use of risk-reducing medications in women not at increased risk (D recommendation).

Accordingly, the USPSTF recommendation for women at low risk for breast cancer is different than its recommendation for women at increased risk.</p>\r\n<p>For women at increased risk for breast cancer, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that taking medications to reduce risk for breast cancer confer a moderate net benefit. Tamoxifen is associated with a greater risk reduction of breast cancer compared with raloxifene but also with a greater risk of endometrial cancer (in women with a uterus), cataracts, and VTEs. These risks increase with age. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene decrease risk of fractures but increase risk of vasomotor symptoms. Aromatase inhibitors also decrease risk of breast cancer in women at increased risk for the disease. No studies are currently available that compare aromatase inhibitors with tamoxifen or raloxifene for risk reduction of primary breast cancer. Some trials of aromatase inhibitors used for the treatment of women with early-stage breast cancer or DCIS suggest that there may be a small increase in cardiovascular disease, such as stroke, with aromatase inhibitors; compared with tamoxifen, which reduces risk of fractures, aromatase inhibitors increase risk of fractures. Whether aromatase inhibitors increase risk of fractures compared with placebo or no treatment is unclear.</p>\r\n<p>For women not at increased risk for breast cancer, the USPSTF found that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors provide only a small benefit in reducing risk for breast cancer but are associated with moderate harms. Overall, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential harms of tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors outweigh the potential benefits in women at low risk of breast cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 15 to February 11, 2019. In response to comments received, the USPSTF has clarified that the recommendation statement does not list every scenario in which medications could be considered but rather provides information on risk factors that clinicians could consider in assessing breast cancer risk with their patients. Some examples are provided to help clinicians understand how to consider these risk factors, but these examples should not be interpreted as a definitive list. Some comments expressed concern that the USPSTF was recommending risk-reducing medications at a lower 5-year breast cancer risk threshold than previously. The USPSTF has not lowered its risk threshold for which it has found a net benefit with risk-reducing medications. Instead, the current recommendation acknowledges the uncertainty around relying on a specific threshold calculated by risk assessment tools to identify women who may benefit from risk-reducing medications and offers an alternative approach to risk assessment of women, which includes clinician consideration of clinical risk factors. Some comments also expressed concern that the USPSTF was no longer recommending &ldquo;shared, informed decision making.&rdquo; As with all of its recommendations, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to discuss with patients the risks and benefits of clinical preventive services in the context of each individual&rsquo;s personal health values and preferences when considering a service. Language clarifying this has been added to the Clinical Considerations section. Last, as requested, additional information is provided on selection of medications and menopausal status, and information on harms of aromatase inhibitors has been clarified in the Clinical Considerations section.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Tamoxifen and raloxifene are selective ER modulators that inhibit ERs in breast tissue and reduce risk for ER-positive breast cancer by blocking the proliferation of estrogen-sensitive epithelial cells where breast cancer can develop. These medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for risk reduction of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit conversion of androgen to estrogen and can reduce risk of ER-positive breast cancer by decreasing the amount of estrogen available to bind to estrogen-sensitive epithelial cells. Aromatase inhibitors have been evaluated for risk reduction of breast cancer in clinical trials, although they are primarily used for treatment rather than risk reduction of primary cancer. Aromatase inhibitors are not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for risk reduction of primary breast cancer.</p>",

The most common pathogen is <em>Escherichia coli</em>, although other bacteria such as <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and group B streptococcus can be involved.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation11\">11</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria varies by age, sex, and pregnancy status.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup> Because of the location and length of the female urethra, women are predisposed to infections of the urinary tract, including asymptomatic bacteriuria.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation5\">5</a></sup> Physiologic changes in both pregnant and older women increase the risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria and a urinary tract infection.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation7\">7</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation11\">11</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup> In general, men are at low risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria, although rates increase with older age.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup> Persons with diabetes are also at increased risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation4\">4</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation6\">6</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with a urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit.

The USPSTF changed the grade for pregnant persons from an &ldquo;A&rdquo; to a &ldquo;B&rdquo; based on the reduced applicability of the previous evidence that included outdated antibiotic treatment regimens and newer evidence that shows a significantly lower risk of pyelonephritis than found in previous reviews. In addition, there are newer concerns about antibiotic use, such as antimicrobial resistance and adverse changes to the microbiome (not addressed in current studies), leading to an increase in the magnitude of potential harms. These factors led the USPSTF to reduce assessments of certainty and magnitude of benefit, resulting in the change of grade.</p>\r\n<p>Since 1996, the USPSTF has maintained an &ldquo;A&rdquo; recommendation for 1-time screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria with urine culture in pregnant persons between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation. The original 1996 recommendation was reaffirmed in 2004 and again in 2008.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation14\">14-16</a></sup> In 1996, the USPSTF found that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in older adult women or women with diabetes and, in a separate recommendation, that screening was not recommended in other asymptomatic adults or older adults who reside in an institution.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation14\">14</a></sup> In 2004, these recommendations were combined into a single recommendation against screening, which was subsequently reaffirmed in 2008.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation15\">15</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation16\">16</a></sup></p>",

Both studies included patients screened at the first prenatal visit with urine culture and treated on detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria. In both studies, few cases of pyelonephritis developed in women in either cohort. Only one of the studies reported additional outcomes, including infant birth weight, prematurity, intrauterine death, and intrauterine growth restriction, although the study was not adequately powered to detect differences in these outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation18\">18</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Twelve trials of pregnant women (n&#8197;=&#8197;2377) screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria and randomized to either a treatment or control condition (placebo or no treatment) were included in the review.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation20\">20-31</a></sup> Most studies were conducted in hospital-based obstetrics-gynecology clinics.

Overall, harms were not reported consistently, which limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the current evidence base.</p>\r\n<p>No studies were identified that addressed the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>The relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and adverse pregnancy outcomes is related to a combination of factors. Women are at increased risk of urinary tract infections, including asymptomatic bacteriuria, because of the anatomical placement of the urethra.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup> Conditions such as increased blood glucose levels and urinary stasis (in which the bladder is unable to completely empty) can increase risk for symptomatic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis. Pregnancy further increases the risk because of changes in urine pH, bladder compression, and urethral dilation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation37\">37</a></sup> Pyelonephritis in pregnancy has been associated with worse pregnancy outcomes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation9\">9</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation37\">37</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation38\">38</a></sup> Screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons could prevent cases of pyelonephritis and associated negative pregnancy outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Antibiotics are the mainstay treatment for urinary tract infections, but there are consequences to their use. The use of antibiotics is known to lead to antimicrobial resistance. In addition, there is emerging evidence that bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts plays a protective role. Antibiotic use can disrupt these effects.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 23 through May 20, 2019. Commenters requested more information about how the USPSTF assessed older evidence. The USPSTF recognizes that older studies have certain limitations. However, in reviewing all available evidence on the benefits and harms of treating screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women, the USPSTF found the evidence to be adequate. Several comments sought clarification on the USPSTF&rsquo;s rationale for changing the grade of the recommendation from an &ldquo;A&rdquo; to a &ldquo;B&rdquo; for pregnant persons. A change in grade may occur when evidence has increased or decreased and results in a change in the certainty or magnitude of net benefit.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening1#citation39\">39</a></sup> Newer evidence, such as the lower prevalence of pyelonephritis and a better understanding of the harms associated with antibiotic use, changed the USPSTF&rsquo;s assessment of both the certainty (from high to moderate certainty) and net benefit of screening (from substantial to moderate net benefit), leading to the grade change.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>Research Needs and Gaps</h1>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There were few studies that examined asymptomatic bacteriuria and risk of serious outcomes (ie, pyelonephritis or urosepsis) in modern pregnant populations. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been low in recent decades, and many antibiotics used in older studies are no longer recommended for use in pregnancy. More observational studies examining this would help improve the applicability of the evidence base.</li>\r\n<li>Clinical trials, observational studies, and natural experiments in settings where asymptomatic bacteriuria screening and treatment are not the standard of care or where guidelines are changing would be useful in assessing benefits and harms.</li>\r\n<li>Newer understandings of the human microbiome suggest that bacterial colonization may play a protective role in both mothers and babies. For pregnant and nonpregnant populations, research is needed to better understand the microbiology of a healthy urinary tract and the natural history of asymptomatic bacteriuria.</li>\r\n<li>The role of current patterns of antibiotic use in the epidemiology of asymptomatic bacteriuria is unclear. Antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance and can change the microbiome. More research is needed to better understand potential harms of treatment and the effects of antibiotic use on newborn, child, and longer-term health</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>",

      "clinical": "<h1>Practice Considerations</h1>\r\n<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>Based on the scope of the evidence review, this recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. However, the randomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 to 75 years. In this Recommendation Statement, the recommendations are stratified by &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;women,&rdquo; although the net benefit estimates are driven by biologic sex (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity. Persons should consider their sex at birth to determine which recommendation best applies to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Important risk factors for AAA include older age, male sex, smoking, and having a first-degree relative with an AAA.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation13\">13-16</a></sup>&nbsp;Other risk factors include a history of other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation17\">17-19</a></sup>&nbsp;Factors associated with a reduced risk include African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, Asian ethnicity, and diabetes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation13\">13</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation20\">20-24</a></sup>&nbsp;Risk factors for AAA rupture include older age, female sex, smoking, and elevated blood pressure.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Clinicians should consider the presence of comorbid conditions and not offering screening if patients are unable to undergo surgical intervention or have a reduced life expectancy.</p>\r\n<h4>Smoking Status</h4>\r\n<p>Epidemiologic literature commonly defines an &ldquo;ever smoker&rdquo; as someone who has smoked 100 or more cigarettes. Indirect evidence shows that smoking is the strongest predictor of AAA prevalence, growth, and rupture rates.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;There is a dose-response relationship, as greater smoking exposure is associated with an increased risk for AAA.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Family History</h4>\r\n<p>Family history of AAA in a first-degree relative doubles the risk of developing AAA.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;The risk of developing an AAA is stronger with a female first-degree relative (odds ratio [OR], 4.32) than with a male first-degree relative (OR, 1.61).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;However, evidence is lacking on whether persons with family history experience a different natural history or surgical outcomes than those without such a history.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The primary method of screening for AAA is conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation26\">26</a></sup>&nbsp;Screening with ultrasonography is noninvasive, is simple to perform, has high sensitivity (94%-100%) and specificity (98%-100%) for detecting AAA,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation27\">27-31</a></sup>&nbsp;and does not expose patients to radiation. Computed tomography is an accurate tool for identifying AAA; however, it is not recommended as a screening method because of the potential for harms from radiation exposure.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Physical examination has been used in practice but has low sensitivity (39%-68%) and specificity (75%) and is not recommended for screening.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation32\">32</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence is adequate to support 1-time screening for men who have ever smoked. All of the population-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of AAA screening used a 1-time screening approach; 7 fair- to good-quality cohort studies and 1 fair-quality case-control study (n&#8197;=&#8197;6785) show that AAA-associated mortality over 5 to 12 years is rare (&lt;3%) in men with initially normal results on ultrasonography (defined as an AAA &lt;3 cm in diameter).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of AAA depends on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk of operative mortality. Larger size is associated with an increased risk of rupture. The annual risk for rupture is nearly 0% for persons with AAAs between 3.0 and 3.9 cm in diameter, 1% for those with AAAs between 4.0 and 4.9 cm in diameter, and 11% for those with AAAs between 5.0 and 5.9 cm in diameter.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Surgical repair is standard practice for men with an AAA of 5.5 cm or larger in diameter or an AAA larger than 4.0 cm in diameter that has rapidly increased in size (defined as an increase of 1.0 cm in diameter over a 1-year period). Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become the most common approach for elective AAA repair. Open repair is a time-tested, effective treatment for AAA. In the United States, 80% of intact AAA repairs and 52% of ruptured AAA repairs are performed using EVAR.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority of screen-detected AAAs (&ge;90%) are between 3.0 and 5.5 cm in diameter and thus below the usual threshold for surgery. The current standard of care for patients with stable smaller aneurysms is to maintain ultrasound surveillance at regular intervals because the risk of rupture is small. Recommended surveillance intervals for monitoring the growth of small AAAs vary across guideline groups, and adherence with surveillance guidelines has been reported to be as low as 65%.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Repairing smaller aneurysms with a lower risk of rupture increases the harms and reduces the benefits of screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>The estimated prevalence of AAA in women is reportedly less than that in men.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The Chichester trial reported a prevalence in women that was one-sixth of the prevalence in men (1.3% vs 7.6%), and most AAA-related deaths occurred in women 80 years or older (70% vs &lt;50% in men).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation33\">33</a></sup>&nbsp;In women, small AAAs have an increased risk of rupture, and rupture at an older age than in men.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Studies estimate that one-fourth to one-third of women have an AAA with a diameter below the current 5.5-cm threshold at the time of rupture.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Operative mortality associated with AAA is higher in women than in men. Women had higher 30-day mortality rates (2.31%) than men (1.37%) after EVAR procedures (OR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.38-2.04]) and open repair (5.37% vs 2.82%; OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.35-2.30]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation34\">34</a></sup>&nbsp;Women also experience higher rates of other harms, such as major surgical complications and hospital readmission, after elective open repair or EVAR compared with men.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence is insufficient to accurately characterize current practice patterns related to screening for AAA in women.</p>\r\n<p>The standard of care for elective repair is that patients with an AAA of 5.5 cm or larger in diameter should be referred for surgical intervention with either open repair or EVAR.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;This recommendation is based on RCTs conducted in men. The AAA size needed for surgical intervention in women may differ. As a result, guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery recommend repairing AAAs between 5.0 and 5.4 cm in diameter in women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation26\">26</a></sup>&nbsp;However, concerns about poorer surgical outcomes in women, who have more complex anatomy and smaller blood vessels, have led some to caution against lowering the threshold for surgical intervention in women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>Update on Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h1>\r\n<p>This recommendation incorporates new evidence and replaces the 2014 USPSTF recommendation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening1#citation35\">35</a></sup><span>&nbsp;It is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF recommendation, which was a B recommendation for 1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in asymptomatic men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked, a C recommendation for selective screening in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked, a D recommendation against routine screening in asymptomatic women who have never smoked, and an I statement for women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked.</span></p>",

Early detection and diagnosis of dementia through the assessment of signs and symptoms recognized by the patient, family, or clinician, which may be subtle, are not considered screening and are therefore not the focus of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Increasing age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive impairment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;The &epsilon;4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (<em>apoE</em>) gene is a reported risk factor for Alzheimer disease in white and Asian populations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Other risk factors include cardiovascular risk factors (eg, diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia), depression, physical frailty, low education level, and low social support level.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation10\">10-13</a></sup>&nbsp;Several dietary and lifestyle factors have been reported as associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment. These include adequate folic acid intake, low saturated fat intake, higher longer-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake, high fruit and vegetable intake, the Mediterranean diet, moderate alcohol intake (1 to 6 drinks per week vs abstention), higher educational attainment, cognitive engagement, social engagement, and higher physical activity levels.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation11\">11</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation14\">14</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation15\">15</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Many different brief screening tests for cognitive impairment are available. Screening tests generally include asking patients to perform a series of tasks that assess 1 or more domains of cognitive function. These tests are not intended to diagnose MCI or dementia. A positive screening test result should lead to additional testing that can include blood tests, radiology examinations, and a medical and neuropsychologic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of dementia and determine its subtype.</p>\r\n<p>The most well-studied screening instrument is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Other screening instruments include the clock drawing test (CDT), Memory Impairment Screen (MIS)/MIS by Telephone (MIS-T), Mental Status Questionnaire (MSQ), Mini-Cog verbal fluency, 8-Item Informant Interview (AD8), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), 7-Minute Screen (7MS), Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS), Telephone Instrument for Cognitive Status (TICS), and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). For more information on all screening instruments reviewed by the USPSTF, see the full evidence report.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation17\">17</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of cognitive impairment may focus on one or more signs and symptoms, including cognition, quality of life, mood, and behavioral impairments.</p>\r\n<p>Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions aim to slow, prevent, or reverse cognitive impairment; stabilize or improve functional performance; improve caregiver burden and depression; or improve patient, caregiver, and clinician decision-making. Pharmacologic treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for Alzheimer disease include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine. Nonpharmacologic interventions include cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation, cognitive stimulation interventions, exercise, peer support, psychoeducation, and care management.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Dementia affects an estimated 2.4 to 5.5 million persons in the United States, and its prevalence increases with age. Dementia affects an estimated 9.9% of persons aged 75 to 84 years and 29.3% of those 85 years or older.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Subjective memory issues are common in adults, with studies showing that approximately 50%<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;to 75%<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;of adults have at least minor concerns about their memory.</p>\r\n<p>Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for cognitive impairment, there may be important reasons to identify cognitive impairment early. Burdens of cognitive impairment include direct effects on the patient (eg, loss of function and relationships, financial misjudgments, and nonadherence with recommended therapies), direct effects on caregivers (eg, burden and depression), and effects on society (eg, costs of care). Early detection of cognitive impairment can allow for identification and treatment of reversible causes, may help clinicians anticipate problems patients may have in understanding and adhering to medical treatment plans, and may also be useful by providing a basis for advance planning on the part of patients and families. Clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment (eg, problems with memory or language) and evaluate the individual as appropriate. However, none of the potential benefits of screening have been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence about the harms of screening is limited. One potential harm is labeling a person with an illness that is typically progressive and for which treatment appears to have limited effectiveness. Some studies have shown higher stress, greater depression, and lower quality of life in persons aware of a diagnosis of cognitive impairment,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation20\">20</a></sup>&nbsp;while others have found no such association.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation21\">21</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation22\">22</a></sup>&nbsp;Evidence about the effects of false-positive results is limited. AChEIs are associated with harms, some of which are serious, including central nervous system disturbances, bradycardia, and falls. Evidence about the harms of nonpharmacologic interventions is limited, but these harms are assumed to be small.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Most commonly, evaluation for or diagnosis of cognitive impairment occurs as a result of patient- or caregiver-reported concerns or symptoms, or clinician&rsquo;s suspicion. As many as 29% to 76% of patients with dementia are unrecognized in the primary care setting.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation23\">23-25</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2011, Medicare added detection of cognitive impairment to its annual wellness visit. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services recommend assessing a patient&rsquo;s cognitive function by direct observation; considering information and concerns reported by the patient, family members, friends, caregivers, and others; and, if deemed appropriate, using a brief validated, structured cognitive assessment tool.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation26\">26</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><sup>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</sup></strong></p>\r\n<p>This recommendation updates the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.

      "discussion": "<p><strong>Supporting Evidence</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;on the benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment, including MCI and mild to moderate dementia, in community-dwelling adults, including those 65 years or older residing in independent living facilities. The systematic review included evidence on the accuracy of screening tests to detect cognitive impairment and the benefits and harms of treatments and interventions for older adults with cognitive impairment and their caregivers. The review focused on older adults with MCI or mild to moderate dementia, as these are the patients most likely to be identified by screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 59 studies that evaluated 49 screening instruments to detect cognitive impairment. Among the studies, the prevalence of dementia ranged from 1% to 47% and the prevalence of MCI ranged from 10% to 52%. The mean age of participants ranged from 68 to 95 years. Education level of participants, which was reported in 22 studies, ranged from a mean of 5 to 16 years of education. Most of the instruments evaluated were very brief (evaluation time &le;5 minutes) or brief (evaluation time &le;10 minutes).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Screening instruments evaluated in more than 1 study included the MMSE, CDT, MIS/MIS-T, MSQ, Mini-Cog verbal fluency, AD8, FAQ, 7MS, AMT, Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, MoCA, SLUMS, TICS, and IQCODE. The MMSE was the most evaluated instrument (30 studies). The MMSE is an 11-item instrument with a maximum score of 30 points. In a pooled analysis of 14 studies using cutoffs of 23 or less or 24 or less (score considered a positive screening result) (n&#8197;=&#8197;11,972), the MMSE had a sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.92) and a specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93) to detect dementia. The other instruments were studied in fewer studies (2 to 9 studies), and cutoffs for screening instruments often varied across studies. Sensitivity and specificity of these instruments to detect dementia varied widely in these studies, from 0.43 to 1.0 and 0.54 to 1.0, respectively. Across all instruments, test accuracy (ie, sensitivity and specificity) was generally higher to detect dementia compared with MCI.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 1 trial, IU-CHOICE<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation37\">37</a></sup>&nbsp;(n&#8197;=&#8197;4005), that examined the effect of screening for cognitive impairment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), health care utilization, and measures of advance care planning. This trial found no differences in HRQOL at 1, 6, or 12 months and no differences in health care utilization or measures of advance care planning at 12 months in screening compared with control groups. Limitations of this trial include that 38% of persons assessed for eligibility refused to participate, and 66% of participants who screened positive refused diagnostic assessment and follow-up. Additionally, the trial was missing 42% of HRQOL outcomes data at 12 months.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 48 trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;22,431) that evaluated the effects of AChEIs (donepezil [18 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;6209], galantamine [10 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;7464], rivastigmine [8 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;4569], and memantine [12 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;4189]) on global cognitive function. Many of these trials reported differences in scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale&ndash;Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog-11) or the MMSE. AChEIs and memantine improved measures of global cognitive function in the short term, but the magnitude of change was small. In pooled analyses, the differences in changes between patients taking AChEIs or memantine compared with patients taking placebo ranged from approximately 1 to 2.5 points on the ADAS-Cog-11 (scale range, 0-70) and 0.5 to 1 points on the MMSE (scale range, 0-30) over 3 months to 3 years of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup>&nbsp;Changes of this magnitude would generally not be considered clinically important.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation38\">38</a></sup>&nbsp;AChEIs and memantine increased the likelihood of improving or maintaining patients&rsquo; global function, typically as assessed by the Clinician&rsquo;s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Informant Input (CIBIC+), by 15% (for memantine) to 50% (for rivastigmine) in the short term; however, change at longer-term follow-up was not reported.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Most of the evidence on the effectiveness of AChEIs and memantine comes from trials involving persons with dementia, particularly those with moderate as opposed to mild dementia, and most commonly Alzheimer disease. Four trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;1919) tested donepezil or memantine in persons with MCI. These trials showed no improvement in global cognitive function.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Twenty-nine trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;6489) evaluated other medications or supplements, including antihypertensives, statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gonadal steroids, and dietary supplements and vitamins (multivitamins, B vitamins, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids). None of the trials found any improvement in global cognition or physical function in persons with mild to moderate dementia or MCI.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Sixty-one trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;7847) evaluated nonpharmacologic patient-level interventions, including cognitive-focused, exercise, multicomponent, and other interventions. In general, these trials were small and of limited duration. This body of evidence represented persons with dementia and MCI, with a mean age of 75 years. Among all interventions, there was no clear improvement in global or domain-specific measures of cognitive function compared with controls at 3 months to 2 years of follow-up.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Fifty-eight trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;9139) evaluated psychoeducation interventions targeting the caregiver or caregiver-patient dyad. Most trials targeted patients with dementia, and the average MMSE score in studies that reported it was 16.2, consistent with moderate dementia. The interventions were highly variable, with most including training in problem solving, communications, and stress management, in addition to providing information about dementia and community resources. Overall, there was a small improvement in caregiver burden and depression measures, primarily in persons caring for patients with moderate dementia. For example, a pooled analysis of 9 trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;1089) that reported change in the Zarit-22 (a 22-item scale of caregiver burden, with a score ranging from 0 to 88) found an average 2.5-point improvement (mean difference, &ndash;2.5 [95% CI, &ndash;3.9 to &ndash;1.0]), and a pooled analysis of 20 trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;2603) that reported change in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) (a 20-item scale of depressive symptoms, with a score ranging from 0 to 60) found a mean 2.67-point improvement (mean difference, &ndash;2.67 [95% CI, &ndash;3.45 to &ndash;1.48]) in the intervention groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Seventeen trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;3039) evaluated care or case management interventions. All interventions were intended for patients with dementia. Of the 12 trials that reported caregiver burden outcomes, 5 found a statistically significant improvement in scores. A pooled analysis of 8 trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;1215) found a standardized pooled effect of &ndash;0.54 (95% CI, &ndash;0.85 to &ndash;0.22), translating to a between-group difference of approximately 3.5 to 4 points on the Zarit-22. Seven trials reported caregiver depression outcomes. A pooled analysis of 4 of these trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;668) showed no improvement in caregiver depression measures.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Two trials reported the effects of interventions on planning or decision-making outcomes. One trial (n&#8197;=&#8197;111)<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation39\">39</a></sup>&nbsp;reported the effects of a psychoeducational intervention on caregivers&rsquo; planning or decision-making related to caring for a relative with dementia. Three months after the intervention, caregivers in both the intervention and usual care groups reported significantly better planning for future needs, and there was no difference between the intervention and usual care groups. A second trial (the Maximizing Independence at Home [MIND] Care Coordination Trial) (n&#8197;=&#8197;303)<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation40\">40</a></sup>&nbsp;assessed whether a care coordination intervention reduced unmet care needs related to dementia compared with usual care. Evaluators assessed 19 common care needs for participants (71 items) and caregivers (15 items) as being either &ldquo;fully met&rdquo; or &ldquo;unmet.&rdquo; After 18 months, there was no difference in reduction of total percentage of unmet needs in the intervention group vs usual care.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, the body of evidence on the potential benefits of screening for cognitive impairment is limited by several factors. These include the short duration of most trials (often &le;6 months for pharmacologic agents and &le;1 year for nonpharmacologic interventions), as well as the heterogeneous nature of interventions and inconsistency in the outcomes reported, which make cross-study comparisons difficult. As noted, for interventions for which studies reported an improvement in measures, the average effect sizes were small and of uncertain clinical importance. In addition, no interventions specifically targeted a screen-detected population. Most of the evidence suggesting improvement is applicable to persons with moderate dementia; thus, its applicability to a screen-detected population is uncertain.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 1 trial (IU-CHOICE)<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation37\">37</a></sup>&nbsp;that addressed the potential harms of screening for cognitive impairment. This trial and its limitations are described above. The trial found no differences in depression or anxiety (as measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7) in participants randomized to screening vs control groups at 1, 6, or 12 months.</p>\r\n<p>Forty-eight randomized clinical trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;22,431) and 3 observational studies (n&#8197;=&#8197;190,076) reported on the harms of treatment with AChEIs and memantine.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup>&nbsp;Adverse effects of medications were common. Adverse events were significantly higher in patients receiving AChEIs, and more patients receiving AChEIs withdrew from studies or discontinued their medication compared with patients receiving placebo. Memantine was better tolerated, with no increase in adverse events or withdrawal rates compared with placebo. Overall, there was no increase in serious adverse events in patients taking AChEIs. However, some individual studies reported increased rates of serious adverse events, such as bradycardia, syncope, falls, and need for pacemaker placement among patients taking AChEIs.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty-one of the trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;5688) that evaluated other medications or supplements reported on harms. Harms were not clearly significantly increased in intervention groups compared with control groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup>&nbsp;For nonpharmacologic patient-level interventions, few studies reported on harms. Little harm was evident in the 12 studies (n&#8197;=&#8197;2370) that reported it.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation16\">16.17</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 10, 2019, to October 7, 2019. Several comments agreed that the evidence on screening for cognitive impairment is insufficient. Several comments expressed that readers might misinterpret the I statement as a recommendation against screening, or interpreted the I statement as a recommendation against screening. In response, the USPSTF wants to clarify that its I statement is a conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment and is neither a recommendation for nor against screening. Several comments disagreed with the I statement and felt that the USPSTF should recommend screening for cognitive impairment based on the potential benefits mentioned in the Practice Considerations section. In response, the USPSTF clarified that while there&nbsp;<em>may</em>&nbsp;be important reasons to identify cognitive impairment early, none of the potential benefits mentioned in this section have been clearly demonstrated in controlled trials. Several comments noted that cognitive impairment often goes unrecognized. The USPSTF agrees and added language to the Practice Considerations section noting that clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment. Some comments suggested additional studies that should be considered by the USPSTF. Some of the suggested studies investigated the prevention of cognitive impairment by controlling risk factors, such as hypertension, or by use of a multidomain intervention (eg, diet, physical activity, cognitive training, and risk factor control). However, none of these suggested studies met inclusion criteria for this recommendation; that is, they were not studies of screening for and/or treatment of cognitive impairment or mild to moderate dementia. Also, the USPSTF added the American Academy of Neurology&rsquo;s guidelines on the detection of cognitive impairment to the Recommendations of Others section.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Dementia can be the result of varied and different pathophysiologic processes affecting the brain, and the exact causal mechanism for many types of dementia is unknown. Therefore, the development of early interventions that result in important clinical effects on dementia has been challenging. The most common cause of dementia in the United States is Alzheimer disease, which is the target of all current drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for dementia. Since current medical therapies for dementia do not appear to affect its long-term course, the potential benefit of screening may be in devising effective interventions that can help patients and caregivers prepare for managing the symptoms and consequences of dementia.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>More research is needed on the effect of screening and early detection of cognitive impairment (MCI and mild to moderate dementia) on important patient, caregiver, and societal outcomes, including decision-making, advance planning, and caregiver outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>The body of evidence on screening and interventions for cognitive impairment would benefit from more consistent definitions and reporting of outcomes to allow comparisons across trials, especially from trials with longer-term follow-up.</li>\r\n<li>Studies are needed of the effects of caregiver or patient-caregiver dyad interventions on delay or prevention of institutionalization, and the effects of delay in institutionalization on caregivers.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed on treatments that clearly affect the long-term clinical course of cognitive impairment. It is also important that studies on screening and interventions for cognitive impairment report harms and reasons for attrition of trial participants</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p><span>The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation41\">41</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The American Academy of Neurology has published guidance on the detection of cognitive impairment during the annual wellness visit and recommends the use of a brief, validated cognitive assessment instrument to assess for cognitive impairment.</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation42\">42</a></sup><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Tools and Resources</strong></p>\r\n<p><span>The National Institute on Aging has useful information on the definition, detection, and management of cognitive impairment for patients and clinicians, including links to some screening instruments, on its website.</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation27\">27</a></sup></p>\r\n<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Other related USPSTF Recommendations</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The USPSTF has recommendations related to several risk factors for cognitive impairment, including pharmacotherapy and counseling for tobacco cessation;</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation28\">28</a></sup><span>&nbsp;screening and counseling to reduce unhealthy alcohol use;</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation29\">29</a></sup><span>&nbsp;counseling to promote healthful diet and physical activity;</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation30\">30</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation31\">31</a></sup><span>&nbsp;statins to reduce cardiovascular disease risk;</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation32\">32</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and screening for hypertension,</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation33\">33</a></sup><span>&nbsp;abnormal blood glucose levels,</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation34\">34</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and depression.</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening1#citation35\">35</a></sup></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

HCV prevalence has doubled in women aged 15 to 44 years from 2006 to 2014.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation11\">11</a></sup>&nbsp;From 2011 to 2014, 0.73% of pregnant women tested had an HCV infection, with a 68% increase in the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Approximately 1700 infected infants are born annually to 29,000 HCV-infected mothers.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation11\">11</a></sup>&nbsp;Because of the increasing prevalence of HCV in women aged 15 to 44 years and in infants born to HCV-infected mothers, clinicians may want to consider screening pregnant persons younger than 18 years.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening with anti-HCV antibody testing followed by polymerase chain reaction testing for HCV RNA is accurate for identifying patients with chronic HCV infection.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;Currently, diagnostic evaluations are often performed with various noninvasive tests that have lower risk for harm than liver biopsy for diagnosing fibrosis stage or cirrhosis in persons who screen positive.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation12\">12</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Among patients with abnormal results on liver function tests (measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin levels) who were tested for reasons other than HCV screening, finding the cause of the abnormality often includes testing for HCV infection and is considered case finding rather than screening; therefore, it is outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Most adults need to be screened only once. Persons with continued risk for HCV infection (eg, PWID) should be screened periodically. There is limited information about the specific screening interval that should occur in persons who continue to be at risk for new HCV infection or how pregnancy changes the need for additional screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Important considerations for implementation of screening include (1) communicating to patients that screening is voluntary and undertaken only with the patient&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding that HCV screening is planned; (2) informing patients about HCV infection, how it can (and cannot) be acquired, the meaning of positive and negative test results, and the benefits and harms of treatment; and (3) providing patients the opportunity to ask questions and to decline screening.</p>\r\n<p>Some health care systems serving insured populations, some academic medical centers, and the Veterans Health Administration have achieved high rates of HCV screening and treatment. However, national HCV screening rates in community health centers and from the National Health Interview Study were 8.3% and 17.3%, respectively; 1 study of 4 safety-net primary care practices serving low-income and uninsured or underserved populations found that only 0.8% of persons born in 1945 through 1965 were screened over a 1-year period.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;Implementation of successful screening may require addressing various barriers to screening and treatment in diverse populations, such as the uninsured.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The purpose of antiviral treatment regimens for HCV infection is to prevent long-term health complications of chronic HCV infection (eg, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma).</p>\r\n<p>Currently, all oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens without interferon have been accepted as the standard treatment for chronic HCV infection. Antiviral therapy is not generally considered during pregnancy because of the lack of data on the safety of newer DAA regimens during pregnancy and breastfeeding.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation14\">14</a></sup><sup>,&nbsp;</sup><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation15\">15</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides strategies for implementing a testing program and additional risk factors at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/guidelinesc.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/guidelinesc.htm</a><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer\">This link goes offsite.

Direct-acting antiviral regimens are of shorter duration, with higher rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) and fewer serious harms than previous treatment regimens. Since 2013, the prevalence of HCV infection has increased in younger persons aged 20 to 39 years. There are limited epidemiologic data available on HCV incidence in adolescents younger than 18 years. The HCV infection prevalence rates in older adults born between 1945 and 1965 remain relatively high, and prevalence in the elderly will increase as this population ages. Clinical trials of DAA treatment included adults in their early 80s, which increases the evidence for the benefits of screening in older adults. In addition, many older adults could experience the benefits of screening. As a result, the USPSTF concluded that broadening the age for HCV screening beyond its previous recommendation will identify infected patients at earlier stages of disease who could greatly benefit from effective treatment before developing complications.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>",

Of the trials of DAA regimens (n&#8197;=&#8197;7167; 26% to 69% female; mean age, 45 to 62 years), 14 were multinational; 11 were conducted in the US or Canada; and the remainder were conducted in New Zealand, Egypt, France, or Asia. In 29 trials, 60% to 100% of patients were white.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The trials evaluated a variety of DAA regimens recommended in current guidelines. Treatment duration was 12 weeks in all but 2 trials, which allocated patients to either 8 or 12 weeks of treatment. Eleven trials were of good quality and 22 were of fair quality. Forty-nine trials found DAA regimens to be associated with pooled SVR rates ranging from 95.5% to 98.9% across genotypes.

Some comments asked for a definition of &ldquo;high risk&rdquo;; however, an extensive list of risk factors is beyond the scope of this recommendation statement. The Additional Tools and Resources section provides a link to other resources. Some comments expressed concern about the lack of guidance on screening intervals for pregnant adults. In response, the USPSTF added language to the Practice Considerations section. Some comments raised concerns about implementation. In response, the USPSTF added language about counseling and consent to the Screening Implementation section. Some comments urged more research on the benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant adults. The USPSTF clarified its call for research in pregnant persons in the Research Needs and Gaps section.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Addressing several key research gaps could help inform the benefit of screening for HCV infection in US-based populations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Research is needed on the yield of repeat vs 1-time screening for HCV and different repeat screening intervals to inform recommendations on optimal screening intervals for persons at high risk.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed to identify labor management practices (eg, prolonged rupture of membranes or use of internal fetal monitoring) and treatment of HCV infection prior to pregnancy to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Research is also needed on the benefits and harms of additional screening during pregnancy for low-risk persons who have been previously screened.</li>\r\n<li>Trials and cohort studies that measure effects on quality of life, function, and extrahepatic effects of HCV infection (eg, renal function, cardiovascular effects, or diabetes) would be helpful for evaluating the effects of DAA regimens on short-term health outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Additional studies are needed to examine the epidemiology of HCV infection and the effectiveness of DAA regimens in adolescents</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>\r\n<p><span>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in the process of updating its HCV screening guidelines. Its draft screening guideline recommends screening for HCV at least once in a lifetime for all adults 18 years and older, except in settings where the prevalence is less than 0.1%. All pregnant persons should be screened for HCV during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%. All persons with risk factors (eg, persons with HIV, prior recipients of blood transfusions, persons who ever injected drugs and shared needles, and persons who are born to an HCV-infected mother) should be tested for HCV, with periodic testing while risk factors persist.</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation25\">25</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering HCV screening to pregnant persons with risk factors.</span><sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/hepatitis-c-screening1#citation26\">26</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 1-time routine, opt-out HCV screening for all persons 18 years and older and 1-time testing for all persons younger than 18 years at increased risk of HCV exposure.

Bacterial vaginosis occurs when there is a shift in this flora to include a greater proportion of mixed anaerobic bacteria, such as the <em>Gardnerella</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, and <em>Atopobium</em> species.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation12\">12</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation13\">13</a></sup> Most often, bacterial vaginosis is asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they include off-white, thin, homogenous discharge, a vaginal &ldquo;fishy&rdquo; odor, or both.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Persons who are not at increased risk for preterm delivery include pregnant persons with no history of previous preterm delivery or other risk factors for preterm delivery. While multiple factors increase risk for preterm delivery, one of the strongest risk factors is prior preterm delivery. See the Potential Preventable Burden section for additional information on risk factors for preterm delivery.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening tests for bacterial vaginosis are performed on vaginal secretions obtained during a pelvic examination in a primary care setting. Available screening tests include nucleic acid assays, sialidase assays, and clinical assessment (ie, using the Amsel criteria of pH, vaginal discharge, clue cells, and &ldquo;whiff test&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Oral metronidazole and oral clindamycin, as well as vaginal metronidazole gel or clindamycin cream, are the usual treatments for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis. The optimal treatment regimen for pregnant persons with bacterial vaginosis is unclear.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website provides current treatment recommendations.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Bacterial vaginosis occurs in as many as 29% of women in the US<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation15\">15</a></sup> and in 5.8% to 19.3% of pregnant women, depending on the specific population being studied.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation16\">16</a></sup> Reported factors that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include African American race, poverty, smoking, increased body mass index, vaginal douching, low educational attainment, and certain sexual behaviors, including a high number of partners, lack of condom or contraceptive use, vaginal sex, sex with a female partner, and concurrent sexually transmitted infections.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation15\">15</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation17\">17</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation18\">18</a></sup> Causes of preterm delivery are likely multifactorial, and numerous risk factors are associated with an increased risk for preterm birth.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup> History of a prior preterm delivery is associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds for preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation19\">19</a></sup> While bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy is associated with a 2-fold higher odds for preterm delivery,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation2\">2</a></sup> it is not clear that bacterial vaginosis is a cause of preterm delivery. Other additional risk factors for preterm delivery include, but are not limited to, cervical insufficiency, multifetal gestation, young or advanced maternal age, low maternal body mass index (&lt;20, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), genitourinary infections, HIV infection, and other maternal medical conditions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation20\">20-23</a></sup> The association of these additional risk factors with preterm delivery is small to moderate, and factors can act in isolation or in combination. Preterm birth rates also vary by race/ethnicity in the US; recent data report preterm birth rates of 8.6% among Asian women, 11.8% among Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander women, 9.7% among Hispanic women, 11.5% among American Indian/Alaska Native women, 14.1% among black women, and 9.1% among white women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation7\">7</a></sup> Among women with a prior preterm delivery, the rate of recurrent preterm delivery in African American women is 4 times higher than the rate of recurrent preterm delivery in white women.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation20\">20</a></sup> Even when these risk factors are present, it is unclear whether screening and treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery prevents preterm delivery. African American race is both associated with bacterial vaginosis and strongly associated with preterm delivery. Other factors associated with both bacterial vaginosis and preterm delivery include young age, nulliparity, current tobacco use, low educational attainment, lower income, and concurrent sexually transmitted infections. Five studies provided evidence on the benefit of treatment of bacterial vaginosis in women with a previous preterm delivery for reducing the incidence of preterm delivery. Four of these studies evaluated the treatment of bacterial vaginosis with oral metronidazole6 and reported the incidence of preterm delivery at less than 37 weeks. Three of these studies reported statistically significant absolute reductions in preterm delivery after treatment (ranging from 18% to 29% absolute reductions in risk), and 1 study reported no significant difference. Limitations of the evidence, including imprecision, the fact that some of the results were from subgroup analyses, and the inconsistency of results, prevented a definitive conclusion about the benefit.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup> Two studies (1 evaluating oral metronidazole and the other evaluating vaginal clindamycin) presented results for preterm delivery at less than 34 weeks, and the results were mixed.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons and treatment with antibiotics generally involve adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and vaginal candidiasis.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup> Four observational studies and 2 large meta-analyses of observational studies on the use of metronidazole during pregnancy for any reason (not limited to bacterial vaginosis) reported no increase in congenital malformations or incident cancer in children exposed in utero.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation24\">24-29</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>No data are available on how frequently pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery are screened for bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy, but screening in asymptomatic pregnant persons is not recommended by any large US professional organization. Clinicians routinely test and treat pregnant persons for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis. Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation The USPSTF last issued a recommendation on this topic in 2008. Although newer evidence was reviewed, the recommendations have essentially remained the same. The language used to describe a pregnant person&rsquo;s risk for preterm delivery has been updated to be more consistent with other current USPSTF recommendations.</p>",

Epidemiologic data suggest that risk for preterm delivery may be higher when asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is present (pooled odds ratio, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.56-3.00]; 32 studies; 30,518 participants).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/bacterial-vaginosis-in-pregnancy-to-prevent-preterm-delivery-screening#citation2\"><span>2</span></a></sup> However, the causal pathway of how bacterial vaginosis may lead to preterm delivery is unclear. Earlier theories postulated that bacterial vaginosis may lead to upper genital tract infections, which may in turn contribute to&nbsp; preterm PROM or preterm labor. More recently, it has been suggested that maternal vaginal mucosal immune response may play a role in preterm labor or preterm PROM, as well as acquisition of bacterial vaginosis. Although the evidence is clear that treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery does not prevent preterm delivery, it is still unclear whether treating asymptomatic pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery may help prevent preterm delivery.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 8 to November 4, 2019. In response to public comments, language has been added clarifying that the current recommendation statement applies to screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis. The current recommendation does not address treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis, which is addressed by other treatment guidelines. Additionally, the need for studies that evaluate screening test accuracy in pregnant persons has been added to the Research Needs and Gaps section. Some comments requested additional information on subgroups and additional screening tests.

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions, such as face-to-face or telephone interaction with a health care clinician, print materials, and computer applications, can have a moderate effect in preventing initiation of tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents. The USPSTF sought but found no evidence on the harms of behavioral counseling interventions for the prevention or cessation of tobacco use; however, the USPSTF bounds the magnitude of potential harms of behavioral counseling interventions as no greater than small, based on the absence of reported harms in the literature and the noninvasive nature of the interventions (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#tab1\">Table 1</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Cessation</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is&nbsp;<strong>insufficient evidence</strong>&nbsp;to determine the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions for tobacco cessation among school-aged children and adolescents who already smoke, because of a lack of adequately powered studies on behavioral counseling interventions and a lack of studies on medications.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefit of behavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation in school-aged children and adolescents because many studies had small sample sizes and may not have been adequately powered to detect a benefit, making it unclear whether the observed lack of effect of interventions was the result of intervention failure or lack of statistical power. Although the USPSTF found no evidence on the harms of behavioral counseling interventions, it bounds the magnitude of potential harms of behavioral counseling interventions as no greater than small, based on the absence of reported harms in the literature and the noninvasive nature of the interventions.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of medications for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents, primarily because of an inadequate number of studies that have evaluated tobacco cessation medications in this population. Potential harms depend on the specific medication (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#tab1\">Table 1</a>).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
      "clinical": "<p>Practice</p>\r\n<p>Practice Considerations</p>\r\n<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to school-aged children and adolescents younger than 18 years. The USPSTF has issued a separate recommendation statement on interventions for tobacco use cessation in adults 18 years and older, including pregnant persons.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation16\">16</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Tobacco use&rdquo; refers to use of any tobacco product. As defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tobacco products include any product made or derived from tobacco intended for human consumption (except products that meet the definition of drugs), including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars (including cigarillos and little cigars), dissolvable tobacco, hookah tobacco, nicotine gels, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, smokeless tobacco products (including dip, snuff, snus, and chewing tobacco), vapes, e-cigarettes, hookah pens, and other electronic nicotine delivery systems. &ldquo;Smoking&rdquo; generally refers to the inhaling and exhaling of smoke produced by combustible tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. &ldquo;Vaping&rdquo; refers to the inhaling and exhaling of aerosols produced by e-cigarettes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation17\">17</a></sup>&nbsp;Vape products usually contain nicotine, which is the addictive ingredient in tobacco. Substances other than tobacco can also be used to smoke or vape.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>All youth are considered at risk of initiating tobacco use. Interventions to prevent the initiation of tobacco use should be provided to all youth who have not started using tobacco products yet, regardless of the presence or absence of other risk factors. The following risk factors may increase the risk of tobacco use in youth: being male, white race, not college-bound, from a rural area, having parents with lower levels of education, parental smoking, having childhood friends who smoke, being an older adolescent, experiencing highly stressful events, and perceiving tobacco use as low risk.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation18\">18</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation19\">19</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Interventions to Prevent Tobacco Use and Implementation Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>Various behavioral counseling intervention types are effective in preventing tobacco initiation in children, including face-to-face counseling, telephone counseling, and computer-based and print-based interventions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Individual interventions target specific audiences (the child/adolescent, the parent, or both) and a variety of age ranges. For example, in the reviewed studies,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;interventions for children aged 7 to 10 years tended to be print-based materials, whereas face-to-face counseling and telephone- and computer-based interventions typically targeted children older than 10 years. Interventions targeting parents tended to be print- or telephone-based. The number of contacts made with intervention recipients also varied, ranging from 1 to 8 contacts.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;The intensity of the interventions varied, with the content of the print materials ranging from stickers to informational newsletters or an activity book (for children) or activity guide (for parents). For telephone-based interventions, telephone counseling was usually provided in conjunction with another modality such as print materials or face-to-face counseling. Based on the evidence reviewed,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;no specific component of behavioral counseling interventions (such as intervention modality, target audience, duration of intervention, or intervention setting) appeared to make an intervention more or less effective. Thus, clinicians have a broad range of effective behavioral counseling interventions from which to choose. For additional information about behavioral counseling interventions to prevent tobacco use, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#tab2\">Table 2</a>, the Additional Tools and Resources section, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#box\">Box</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the evidence on behavioral counseling interventions to prevent tobacco use focused on prevention of cigarette smoking.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;Given the similar contextual and cultural issues currently surrounding the use of e-cigarettes in youth and the inclusion of e-cigarettes as a tobacco product by the FDA, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on interventions to prevent cigarette smoking could be applied to prevention of e-cigarette use as well. The USPSTF also concludes that the evidence could be applied to prevention of cigar use, which includes cigarillos and little cigars.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Primary care

2019, an estimated 1.43 million high school and middle school students reported current use of cigars, 1.15 million high school and middle school students reported current use of conventional cigarettes, and 5.38 million high school and middle school students reported current use of e-cigarettes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;Of high school and middle school students who used any tobacco product in the past 12 months, 57.5% reported that they had at least 1 quit attempt;<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;however, most quit attempts fail, and about 80% will go on to smoke into adulthood.<sup><a

adverse health effects in child and adolescent cigarette smokers include increased negative respiratory effects such as impaired lung growth, early onset of lung function decline, respiratory and asthma-related symptoms (eg, coughing and wheezing), and early abdominal aortic atherosclerosis.<sup><a

regarding use of e-cigarettes in adolescence includes nicotine dependence and toxicity, harm to the developing brain, its use as a bridge to conventional cigarette smoking, and inhalation of carcinogens.<sup><a

the evidence on behavioral counseling interventions to prevent tobacco use in children and adolescents is robust, fewer studies with smaller sample sizes are available that evaluate the effect of behavioral counseling interventions or pharmacotherapy on tobacco cessation.<sup><a

pooled effect of the trials that evaluated behavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation in primary care settings did not find a significant reduction in smokers after the intervention.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;However, the study interventions were heterogeneous and most of the studies were small, making it difficult to determine whether interventions were unsuccessful at helping children and adolescents to stop using tobacco, or whether they were underpowered to detect a difference in tobacco cessation.</p>\r\n<p>No medications are currently approved by the FDA for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents. The label for varenicline now states that it is not indicated in children and adolescents 16 years and younger because its efficacy in this population has not been demonstrated.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation37\">37</a></sup>&nbsp;Few trials have been published on medication use for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents (1 trial on nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] and 2 trials on bupropion sustained-release [SR]).

      "discussion": "<p>Other</p>\r\n<p>Supporting Evidence</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation15\">15</a></sup>&nbsp;to evaluate the benefits and harms of primary care interventions for tobacco use prevention and cessation in children and adolescents. The current systematic review newly included e-cigarettes as a tobacco product.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Primary Care Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Nearly all studies evaluated the effect of interventions on smoking prevention and cessation. As mentioned previously, the USPSTF determined that this evidence could be applied to other forms of tobacco use, including e-cigarette use.</p>\r\n<h3>Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>Fourteen trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;25,049) reported on the effects of behavioral counseling interventions to prevent the initiation of smoking.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;Nine of these trials enrolled only children who were nonsmokers at baseline, while 5 trials enrolled both smokers and nonsmokers but reported results by baseline smoking status. The weighted mean age of participants was 12.8 years, although eligible ages ranged from 7 to 19 years across studies.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Most studies used interventions that targeted the child/adolescent, although some targeted both children and parents/caregivers and a few targeted only the parents/caregivers. Intervention content included health education, readiness to act or change, and parenting skills (communication and positive parenting). Delivery settings of interventions varied and included primary care clinics, dental clinics, schools (after hours), and the child&rsquo;s home. Various types of interventions were used, including print materials, face-to-face counseling, telephone support, and computer-based interventions. Six of the studies used only a single intervention type, and 8 studies used combinations of various interventions (eg, telephone counseling plus print materials or face-to-face counseling plus a computer-based intervention). Most studies reported that fewer youth initiated smoking when they received a behavioral counseling intervention (follow-up was most commonly at 12 months but ranged from 7 to 36 months).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;This finding was not always statistically significant for individual studies; however, this reduction was statistically significant when results from trials were pooled: 7.4% vs 9.2% of participants initiated smoking in the intervention groups vs the control groups (relative risk, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73-0.92]; 13 studies; n&#8197;=&#8197;21,700).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;No effect modification was found by intervention type, setting, or target population (child vs parent).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Cessation</h3>\r\n<p>Nine trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;2516) reported on the effects of behavioral counseling interventions on smoking cessation in youth; 6 trials had fewer than 65 participants analyzed per intervention group.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;Four trials enrolled only smokers, while 5 trials enrolled both smokers and nonsmokers but reported results by baseline smoking status.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;The weighted mean average age of participants in cessation trials was much older than in the prevention trials (16.6 years [range, 12-19 years]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Nearly all interventions targeted the child/adolescent and very few targeted parents/caregivers. Intervention content most commonly focused on assessing and facilitating the youth&rsquo;s readiness to change; a few interventions included health education. The delivery setting of interventions was most commonly a primary care or dental clinic; a few studies delivered interventions at home. Nearly all interventions used combinations of intervention types, most commonly face-to face counseling; telephone- and computer-based interventions and print materials (1 intervention) were used less commonly. Two trials reported significant increases in smoking cessation rates in youth receiving interventions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation21\">21</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation43\">43</a></sup>&nbsp;One trial used a combination of motivational interviewing supplemented with handouts, a computer program, and telephone calls;<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation21\">21</a></sup>&nbsp;the other trial used a combination of 1 face-to-face session supplemented with 1 telephone call.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation43\">43</a></sup>&nbsp;Meta-analysis of all 9 trials reported a risk reduction of percent smokers after the intervention that was not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93-1.01]); 80.6% of participants in the intervention groups were still smoking at the end of the study (range, 6-18 months), vs 84.1% in the control groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;However, given the small study sizes, it was unclear whether this finding was a result of the studies being underpowered to detect a change in smoking behavior.

No factors were identified that modified the effect of interventions.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Three trials (n&#8197;=&#8197;788) reported on the effect of medications on smoking cessation in youth.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;Two trials evaluated bupropion SR<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation44\">44</a></sup>,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation45\">45</a></sup>&nbsp;and 1 trial evaluated NRT.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions#citation46\">46</a></sup>&nbsp;All trials were relatively small (211 to 312 participants per trial), and all trials also included behavioral counseling interventions in addition to medications.

to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 25 to July 22, 2019. Several comments requested that the USPSTF recommend behavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation in youth, given the known harms of tobacco use in youth and the lack of proven harms from counseling interventions. The USPSTF only recommends a preventive service when there is at least adequate evidence that there is a net benefit to providing the service; absence of harms from a service is not sufficient evidence for the USPSTF to recommend a preventive service. However, as with all findings of insufficient evidence, the USPSTF calls for more research on identifying ways to help youth who use tobacco to quit. The USPSTF has also clarified in its Practice Considerations section that given the finding of insufficient evidence, health care practitioners should determine if offering behavioral counseling for tobacco cessation to certain individuals is reasonable. Other comments requested clarification about which tobacco products the USPSTF recommendation addresses. The USPSTF clarified this in the USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit section. Additional changes made to the recommendation statement in response to public comment include clarification of which population the recommendation applies to (see the Practice Considerations section), use of the term &ldquo;e-cigarettes&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS)&rdquo; throughout the document to be consistent with the field, and consideration of additional Research Needs and Gaps and Suggested Tools.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Research Needs and Gaps</p>\r\n<p>More studies are needed to identify effective interventions to help children and adolescents who use tobacco products to quit.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Larger, adequately powered studies and studies of new behavioral counseling interventions for cessation are needed.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>These studies should report tobacco cessation outcomes at 6 months or later and should also provide information on components of the behavioral counseling intervention provided in the study (such as intensity of delivery, frequency of contacts, content and type of counseling or materials provided, delivery setting of studies, and training of persons delivering the intervention).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>More studies are needed that evaluate the benefits and harms of medications to help youth with tobacco cessation.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed on interventions tailored specifically to prevent initiation of use and promote cessation of e-cigarette use in youth.

Similar to adolescents, the illicit drugs most commonly used by young adults are marijuana (20.8%) and prescription psychotherapeutics (4.6%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation1\">1</a></sup> Illicit drug use is associated with many negative health, social, and economic consequences and is a significant contributor to 3 of the leading causes of death among young persons (aged 10 to 24 years): unintentional injuries including motor vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation3\">3</a></sup>Assessment of Magnitude of Net BenefitsBecause of limited and inadequate evidence, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that the benefits and harms of primary care&ndash;based interventions to prevent illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults are uncertain and that the <strong>evidence is insufficient</strong> to assess the balance of benefits and harms. More research is needed.See the <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#tab\">Table</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

      "clinical": "<p>Practice</p>\r\n<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to children (11 years and younger), adolescents (aged 12-17 years), and young adults (aged 18-25 years), including pregnant persons. The purpose of this recommendation is to assess the evidence on interventions to prevent the initiation of illicit drug use and thus does not apply to persons who already have a history of regular or harmful illicit drug use. Children, adolescents, and young persons who are regular users of illicit drugs (at least once per week) or have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder are outside the scope of this recommendation.Screening for illicit drug use in adults and adolescents (aged 12-17 years) is covered in a separate recommendation statement.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation5\">5</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Definitions of Illicit Drug Use, Including Nonmedical Drug Use</h3>\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;illicit drug use&rdquo; is defined as the use of substances (not including alcohol or tobacco products) that are illegally obtained or involve nonmedical use of prescription medications; that is, drug use for reasons, for duration, in amounts, or with frequency other than prescribed, or use by persons other than the prescribed individual. Nonmedical drug use also includes the use of over-the-counter medications, such as cough suppressants. Other illicit drugs include household products such as glues, solvents, and gasoline. These substances are ingested, inhaled, injected, or administered using other methods to affect cognition, affect, or other mental processes; to &ldquo;get high&rdquo;; or for other nonmedical reasons.</p>\r\n<h3>Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The body of evidence to recommend specific interventions to prevent initiation of illicit drugs that can be provided or referred from the primary care setting is insufficient. Studied interventions include face-to-face or group counseling, print materials, interactive computer-based tools designed for patient use, and clinician training and quality improvement programs. Studies on these interventions provide inconsistent evidence on the net benefit to behavioral outcomes (drug abstinence or reduced frequency or quantity of illicit drug use) or health outcomes (morbidity, mortality, educational, or legal outcomes).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has several recommendations on substance use&ndash;related services for young persons. The USPSTF is currently updating its recommendations on screening for illicit drug use in adults 18 years and older (B recommendation) and in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (I statement).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF also has recommendations on screening and behavioral counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older (B recommendation) and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (I statement).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation6\">6</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition, the USPSTF is currently updating its recommendations on education or brief counseling interventions to prevent initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (B recommendation) and interventions for the cessation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (I statement).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation7\">7</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Illicit drug use is associated with multiple negative health, social, and economic consequences. In 2011, the Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that approximately 190,000 emergency department visits by persons aged 0 to 21 years involved illicit drug use (not including alcohol),<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation8\">8</a></sup>&nbsp;and more than 79,000 of those visits were related to nonmedical use of opioids in persons aged 12 to 25 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2015, drug overdose (both intentional and unintentional) accounted for 9.7 deaths per 100,000 persons aged 15 to 24 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation10\">10</a></sup>Frequent and heavy illicit drug use is associated with increased risk-taking behaviors while intoxicated, such as driving under the influence, unsafe sexual activity, and violence. In 2016, 73.6% of all deaths in young persons aged 10 to 24 years in the US resulted from 3 causes: unintentional injuries, including motor vehicle crashes (41.1%); suicide (17.3%); and homicide (14.9%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Among the leading health risk behaviors, the use of alcohol and illicit drugs are the primary health risk behaviors that contribute to these causes of death.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation11\">11</a></sup>Illicit drug use can also have harmful long-term consequences. Children and adolescents who initiate marijuana use before age 17 years are more likely to progress to other drug use and drug abuse/dependence as adults compared with those who initiate use after age 18 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation12\">12</a></sup>&nbsp;Studies have linked use of cannabis to poorer academic performance and lower education attainment (ie, dropping out of high school or not obtaining a college degree).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation13\">13-15</a></sup>&nbsp;Persistent illicit drug use starting in adolescence has been associated with negative psychosocial and neurocognitive effects, including increased anxiety and impaired abstract thinking, attention, learning, and psychomotor functioning.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation16\">16</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation17\">17</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inconsistent evidence on potential benefits associated with interventions. There was a small, statistically significant improvement in cannabis use specifically. However, other drug use outcomes (such as any illicit drug use and the number of times used in the last 3 months) failed to demonstrate statistically significant improvement. There was little evidence that interventions to prevent illicit drug use improve health outcomes such as mortality, educational attainment, or legal outcomes.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on potential harms associated with interventions. Only 1 study reported nonspecific &ldquo;adverse events,&rdquo; with no difference between intervention and control groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation18\">18</a></sup>&nbsp;Potential harms include a paradoxical increase in illicit drug use.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation19\">19</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation20\">20</a></sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on the frequency of use of behavioral counseling in primary care to prevent initiation of illicit drug use among nonusers or the escalation of use among persons who do not use illicit drugs regularly.This recommendation replaces the 2014 USPSTF recommendation, which was also an I statement.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation21\">21</a></sup>&nbsp;This recommendation statement incorporates new evidence since 2014 and now includes young adults (aged 18-25 years).</p>",
      "discussion": "<p>Other</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to evaluate the evidence on the potential benefits and harms of interventions to prevent illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation22\">22</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;This review was used to update the 2014 USPSTF recommendation statement.The USPSTF uses the term &ldquo;illicit drug use&rdquo; to reflect a spectrum of behaviors that range from abstinence to severe substance use disorder. The scope of this recommendation includes interventions designed to prevent illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young persons who have never used illicit drugs as well as stopping illicit drug use among those with experimental or limited use. Children, adolescents, and young persons who are regular users of illicit drugs (at least once per week) or have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder are outside the scope of this recommendation. Interventions included in the review were either conducted in a primary care setting or judged to be generalizable to a primary care setting.Although alcohol and tobacco are both psychoactive drugs, they are not the focus of this recommendation. The USPSTF has made separate recommendations on screening and counseling for tobacco and alcohol use in adolescents.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation6\">6</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation24\">24</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 29 studies (N&#8197;=&#8197;18,353) of interventions to prevent illicit drug use.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation22\">22</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;The review included 26 general prevention trials and 3 trials of the Family Spirit program, an intensive home visitation program that targeted pregnant Native American/Alaska Native youth.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation18\">18</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation26\">26</a></sup>&nbsp;Ten of the studies targeted middle school&ndash;aged students (aged 10-14 years) and 2 targeted young adults (aged 17-24 years). The remaining studies focused on high school&ndash;aged youth or covered an age range inclusive of high school&ndash;aged youth. Most (22) of the studies were conducted in the US. Race/ethnicity data were not reported in all studies, although 10 studies included a majority of black and Hispanic youth, 3 were limited to Native American women or girls, and 1 was limited to Asian American women or girls.Half of the interventions (50%) were individual counseling sessions (in person or by telephone), 21% were group sessions or a combination of group and individual sessions, and 35% were primarily computer based. Trials in middle school&ndash;aged youth tended to be more intensive, with an average of 7 to 12 sessions, compared with 1 to 3 sessions in older groups. Most interventions involved the youth alone (68%) or the youth and the parent (23%). Common components of interventions targeted to youth were education about illicit drugs, other substances, or both; correction of normative thoughts or beliefs; and development of social skills, stress management skills, positive peer relationships, refusal skills, and self-esteem. Interventions targeted to parents included information on youth development, communication, monitoring, establishing rules, and positive parenting.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation22\">22</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation23\">23</a></sup>The majority of trials addressed outcomes in addition to illicit drug use, with 9 trials focusing broadly on substance use (including alcohol, tobacco, or both). Other outcomes included family functioning (8 trials), risky sexual behavior (5 trials), mental health and emotional well-being (6 trials), truancy and delinquent behaviors (1 trial), and breastfeeding and infant care (3 trials).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation22\">22</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;Behavioral outcomes included illicit drug use (either any illicit drug use or frequency of use), associated alcohol and tobacco use, delinquent behavior, risky sexual behavior, and unsafe driving.Findings were inconsistent for illicit drug use outcomes across all studies.

Most of the general prevention trials found no group-to-group differences on mental health symptom scales after 3 to 24 months, and results were mixed for the Family Spirit trials. Family functioning (family communication, parental monitoring, and maternal closeness) was reported in 5 trials. Three of these trials reported statistically significant improvements in family functioning (0.3 to 0.6 on a 5-point scale for up to 24 months), although the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation22\">22</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation23\">23</a></sup>&nbsp;Other reported health or related outcomes, such as consequences of illicit drug use (3 trials), health-related quality of life (1 trial), and arrests (1 trial) failed to demonstrate consistent benefit.

Several comments noted that the term &ldquo;prevent or reduce&rdquo; could be interpreted as applying only to persons who have never used illicit drugs or only to those currently using drugs. The primary focus of this recommendation is the prevention of illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults who are not regular drug users (defined as drug use less than 1 time per week). This includes persons who have never used drugs as well as those with early or experimental use. Changes were made to clarify this point.Comments also suggested that research on interventions that can be carried out in schools should be included. These comments also noted that the term &ldquo;primary care&ndash;based&rdquo; is confusing, since many of the reviewed interventions were not carried out in a clinical setting. The USPSTF makes recommendations on interventions that can be conducted in or referred from a clinical setting. As such, only studies that are conducted in or are judged to be generalizable to a primary care setting were included in the review. Language was added to clarify this. The USPSTF wishes to emphasize that screening for drug use in adolescents and young adults is covered in a separate recommendation. As such, evidence on screening interventions was not reviewed in this recommendation. In addition, the USPSTF updated the recommendation to include data from a recent trial<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents#citation44\">44</a></sup>&nbsp;that evaluated the effect of a computer-based intervention for the prevention of youth substance use and associated risky behaviors.The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There was promising evidence that interventions could be effective in preventing cannabis use specifically; however, the benefit to harm ratio could not be determined because of a lack of studies reporting harms. Future research on cannabis prevention that deliberately addresses both benefits and harms is needed.</li>\r\n<li>There was minimal reporting on health, social, or legal outcomes and significant heterogeneity in reporting on drug use outcomes. Standardization of outcome measurement across trials would greatly strengthen the evidence base and improve the ability to pool data.</li>\r\n<li>Several interventions such as the Familias Unidas program (a family-based intervention program focusing on Hispanic youth) and interventions that included clinician training, education, personal coaching, and continuous quality improvement components showed promise in reducing illicit drug use.

      "clinical": "<p>Practice</p>\r\n<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation statement applies to adults 18 years or older, including pregnant and postpartum persons, and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in primary care settings. This statement does not apply to adolescents or adults who have a currently diagnosed drug use disorder or are currently undergoing or have been referred for drug use treatment. This statement applies to settings and populations for which services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. The net benefit assessment does not apply to settings and populations for which treatment cannot be provided or the result of screening is punitive.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>For the purposes of this recommendation, &ldquo;unhealthy drug use&rdquo; is defined as the use of substances (not including alcohol or tobacco products) that are illegally obtained or the nonmedical use of prescription psychoactive medications; that is, use of medications for reasons, for duration, in amounts, or with frequency other than prescribed or by persons other than the prescribed individual. These substances are ingested, inhaled, injected, or administered using other methods to affect cognition, affect, or other mental processes; to &ldquo;get high&rdquo;; or for other nonmedical reasons. Unhealthy drug use is abbreviated as &ldquo;drug use&rdquo; in this recommendation statement.Screening refers to asking 1 or more questions about drug use or drug-related risks in face-to-face, print, or audiovisual format. It does not refer to testing urine, saliva, blood, or other biological specimens for the presence of drugs.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening by asking questions in all adults 18 years or older regardless of risk factors for unhealthy drug use. However, some factors are associated with a higher prevalence of unhealthy drug use. These include being aged 18 to 25 years; male sex; having a mental health condition, personality or mood disorder, or nicotine or alcohol dependence; a history of physical or sexual abuse, parental neglect, or other adversity in childhood; or drug or alcohol addiction in a first-degree relative.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation1\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation9\">9</a></sup>&nbsp;Factors associated with misuse of prescription drugs include history of other drug use, mental illness, pain, and greater access to prescription drugs.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation10\">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Factors associated with prenatal use of drugs include a mental health disorder, interpersonal violence, and family history of substance use.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation11\">11</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tools</h3>\r\n<p>Several screening tools that ask questions about drug use are available for identifying 1 or more classes of unhealthy drug use, the frequency or severity of use, or drug-related health, social, or legal consequences that characterize unhealthy use or drug use disorders. Interviewer-administered tools and self-administered tools appear to have similar accuracy.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation12\">12</a></sup>Primary care practices may consider several factors when selecting screening tools. Brief tools (eg, NIDA [National Institute on Drug Abuse] Quick Screen, which asks 4 questions about use of alcohol, tobacco, nonmedical use of prescription drugs, and illegal drugs in the past year) may be more feasible in busy primary care settings, but longer tools (eg, the 8-item ASSIST [Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test]) that assess risks associated with unhealthy drug use or comorbid conditions may reveal information signaling the need for prompt diagnostic assessment. Tools with questions about nonmedical use of prescription drugs (eg, TAPS [Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medication, and Other Substance Use]) may be useful when clinicians are concerned about prescription misuse. One study reported that drug use questions in the PRO (Prenatal Risk Overview) risk assessment tool were reasonably accurate for identifying drug abuse or dependence in pregnant women.Screening tools are not meant to diagnose drug dependence, abuse, addiction, or drug use disorders. Patients with positive screening results may, therefore, need to be offered or referred for diagnostic assessment.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>There is little evidence about the optimal time to start asking about unhealthy drug use or the optimal interval for screening in adults older than 18 years.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of drug use disorders is based on the type of drug used, the severity of drug use, and the type of use disorder. Many drug use disorders are chronic, relapsing conditions, and many persons who start treatment do not complete treatment.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation13\">13</a></sup>&nbsp;Therefore, treatment must often be repeated to stabilize current drug use, reduce relapse, and achieve abstinence or other treatment goals. Some patients, such as those who are pregnant, nursing, or caring for ill or healthy neonates, may require specialized treatment settings.Pharmacotherapy, which is often provided with individual or group counseling, is the standard for treatment of opioid use disorders involving heroin or prescription opioid use in adults and pregnant and postpartum persons.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation14\">14-16</a></sup>&nbsp;Drug use disorders involving nonopioid drugs, such as cannabis, stimulants, and some prescription drugs, are generally treated with various psychosocial interventions that usually involve multiple sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interventions, contingency management, relapse prevention, community reinforcement, family behavioral therapy, 12-step facilitation therapy, or other behavioral approaches. Intensive interventions usually involve several in-person sessions over several weeks or months.The management of patients who screen positive is usually accompanied by other interventions, including testing for blood-borne pathogens; assessment of misuse of, abuse of, or dependence on alcohol or tobacco; assessment of potentially coexisting mental health disorders; and pain management for patients with pain who are abusing opioids.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>In practice, the benefits and harms of screening may vary because of several health, social, and legal issues. In many communities, affordable, accessible, and timely services for diagnostic assessment and treatment of patients with positive screening results are in limited supply or unaffordable.To minimize the potential adverse effects such as stigma, labeling, or medicolegal consequences of asking questions about drug use and documenting and reporting answers, clinicians should be aware of state requirements and best practices on informed consent for screening, mandatory screening, documenting screening results in medical records, reporting of screening results to medicolegal authorities, and confidentiality protections (see the Additional Tools and Resources section).<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation17\">17-24</a></sup>&nbsp;This recommendation statement applies to settings and populations for which services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. The net benefit assessment does not apply to settings and populations for which treatment is not provided or the result of screening is punitive.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Several tools may help clinicians implement this screening recommendation (<a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#box\">Box</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement for Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Based on a national survey in 2018, 8% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years reported drug use in the last month. Among youth reporting such drug use, the most commonly used substances were marijuana, inhalants, prescription psychotherapeutic drugs, opioids, and hallucinogens.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;An estimated 2.7% met diagnostic criteria for drug dependence or abuse,<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;and the vast majority presented with concurrent mental health diagnoses.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Risk factors for drug use in youth include aggressive childhood behavior, lack of parental supervision, poor social skills, access to drugs at school, and community poverty.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation26\">26</a></sup>Adolescent substance use, including use of heroin and misuse of prescription opioids, is associated with the leading causes of death&mdash;suicide, overdose, unintentional injury, and violence in adolescents and young adulthood.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation25\">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Substance use during this period of rapid brain development can also harm neurocognitive development and endocrine function that, in turn, can impair academic, occupational, and social functioning.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation26\">26-28</a></sup>&nbsp;Adolescents with drug use disorders are also at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, other physical health problems, unintended pregnancies, criminal involvement, and school truancy.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation25\">25</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h4>\r\n<p>Although there is limited evidence on harms, adolescents may experience potential harms from screening for drug use such as labeling and stigmatization. Because of concerns about long-term use of opioid agonists, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricts approval for buprenorphine to youth 16 years or older, and the US Department of Health and Human Services restricts admission to methadone programs to youth younger than 18 years who continue to use opioids after at least 2 rounds of detoxification and psychosocial interventions.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation28\">28</a></sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>About 50% to 86% of pediatricians report routinely screening for substance use, and most screen using their clinical impressions rather than a validated screening tool.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation22\">22</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued recommendation statements on these related topics:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Interventions to prevent drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation29\">29</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening and behavioral counseling interventions for reducing unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents and adults<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation30\">30</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation31\">31</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Primary care interventions to prevent tobacco use in children and adolescents<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation32\">32</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening for depression in adults<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation33\">33</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening for depression in children and adolescents<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation34\">34</a></sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation35\">35</a></sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This recommendation statement replaces the 2008 USPSTF recommendation, which concluded that the evidence at that time was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for illicit drug use in adolescents and adults, including those who were pregnant or postpartum.<sup><a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/drug-use-illicit-screening#citation36\">36</a></sup>&nbsp;This updated statement incorporates new evidence since 2008 about the accuracy of screening tools and the benefits and harms of treatment of unhealthy drug use or drug use disorders. This new evidence supports the current recommendation that primary care clinicians offer screening to adults 18 years or older, including those who are pregnant or postpartum, when services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. The USPSTF continues to conclude that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for drug use in adolescents.</p>",

In the US, common STIs with significant clinical and public health effects include HIV, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV),&nbsp;<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>,&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhea</em>,&nbsp;<em>Treponema pallidum</em>&nbsp;(syphilis), and&nbsp;<em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation1\">1-4</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>All sexually active adolescents are at increased risk for STIs because of the high rates of STIs in this age group and should receive behavioral counseling interventions. Adults at increased risk for STIs include those who currently have an STI or were diagnosed with one within the past year, do not consistently use condoms, have multiple sex partners, or have sex partners within populations with a high prevalence of STIs. Populations with a high prevalence of STIs include persons who seek STI testing or attend STI clinics; sexual and gender minorities; persons who are living with HIV, inject drugs, have exchanged sex for money or drugs, or have entered correctional facilities; and some racial/ethnic minority groups.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation1\">1-4</a></sup>&nbsp;Difference in STI rates among racial/ethnic groups may reflect differences in social determinants of health.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;To determine which adolescents are sexually active, and which adults might engage in activities that may increase their risk for STIs, clinicians should routinely ask their patients for pertinent information about their sexual history.</p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Intervention approaches include in-person counseling, videos, websites, written materials, telephone support, and text messages. Most successful approaches provide information on common STIs and STI transmission; assess the person&rsquo;s risk for acquiring STIs; aim to increase motivation or commitment to safer sex practices; and provide training in condom use, communication about safer sex, problem solving, and other pertinent skills. Interventions that include group counseling and involve high total contact times (defined in the evidence review as more than 120 minutes), often delivered over multiple sessions, are associated with larger STI prevention effects. However, some less intensive interventions have been shown to reduce STI acquisition, increase condom use, or decrease number of sex partners. Interventions shorter than 30 minutes tended to be delivered in a single session.

      "discussion": "<h3>Other</h3>\r\n<h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions for preventing STI acquisition.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation34\">34</a></sup>&nbsp;The review included randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials in adolescents or adults of any sexual orientation, level of reported sexual activity, or pregnancy status that were published after 1999.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Twenty trials assessed STI acquisition in persons at increased risk for STIs based on follow-up test results or diagnoses in medical records or public health registries at least 3 months after interventions started. Most reported STI outcomes after 12 or more months of follow-up. About one-half of trials were conducted in, or recruited participants from, US STI clinics. Other trials recruited participants from primary care, adolescent health, family planning, women&rsquo;s health, or behavioral health clinics, mostly in the US. A few trials recruited participants directly from the community. Nine trials enrolled members of populations with higher rates of STIs such as sexually active adolescents or young adults and persons who reported unprotected intercourse, sex with multiple concurrent sex partners, or other STI risk behaviors. Eleven trials enrolled persons classified as at &ldquo;highest risk for STI&rdquo; who had current, recent, or suspected STI diagnosis or were attending STI clinics. Most participants were younger than 25 years, female, heterosexual, and reported African American or Hispanic race/ethnicity, and most trials specifically enrolled subpopulations defined by race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, gender, pregnancy, or other factors.Many interventions used techniques or concepts from motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, or other established behavioral counseling approaches that aimed to increase STI risk perception, knowledge, motivation, and skills for preventing STI acquisition; to increase consistent condom use; and to reduce unprotected intercourse and the number and concurrency of sex partners. Interventions for adolescents who were not yet sexually active aimed to delay sexual activity or encourage abstinence. Interventions were delivered in person and through computer, video, telephone, text message, or print formats over 1 or more sessions. A majority of the interventions that were shorter than 30 minutes delivered the content in a single session. Control conditions included usual care, attention controls, wait list, or minimal interventions (such as less than 15 minutes of STI information).Behavioral counseling interventions were effective for reducing STI acquisition by approximately 30% based on pooled analysis of 19 trials in persons at increased risk for STIs, of which 10 trials enrolled persons at highest risk (n&#8197;=&#8197;52,072; odds ratio [OR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.54-0.81];&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;74%). Sexually transmitted infection prevention effects were stronger for interventions involving group counseling (8 trials; n&#8197;=&#8197;6567; OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.28-0.78];&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;75%) than for interventions without group counseling (11 trials; n&#8197;=&#8197;45,505; OR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.74-1.08];&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;43%) (<em>P</em>&#8197;=&#8197;0.02). Effects were also stronger for interventions with high total contact times (&gt;120 minutes) (8 trials; n&#8197;=&#8197;3974; OR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.28-0.75;&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;65%) (<em>P</em>&#8197;=&#8197;0.02) than for interventions with moderate total contact times (30 to 120 minutes) (8 trials; n&#8197;=&#8197;9072; OR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.66-1.25];&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;59%) or low total contact times (I<sup>2</sup>&#8197;=&#8197;44%). However, it was unclear whether group counseling format, contact time, or both were responsible for intervention effects because all but 1 group counseling intervention entailed more than 120 minutes.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation34\">34</a></sup>Although interventions with more than 120 minutes of contact time, group counseling, or both were generally more effective, 3 interventions with moderate<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation11\">11</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation14\">14</a></sup>&nbsp;or low<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;contact times and 2 interventions without group counseling<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation14\">14</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;yielded statistically significant reductions in STI acquisition in STI clinic patients. One brief, video-based intervention without in-person counseling was tested in a nonrandomized clinical trial of 40,282 adults in STI clinic waiting rooms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation19\">19</a></sup>&nbsp;Patients who viewed 23 minutes of information about HIV and STI prevention; how couples communicate about newly diagnosed STIs; building skills, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes about condom use; and how to acquire, negotiate, and use condoms were significantly less likely than patients receiving usual care to acquire STIs after a mean of 15 months of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.99]).Meta-regression analysis revealed that intervention effects were stronger in trials limited to adolescents (3 trials; n&#8197;=&#8197;1166; OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.02-2.30];&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;73%) than in trials that included adolescents and adults (16 trials; n&#8197;=&#8197;50,906; OR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.67-0.91];&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;51%). However, it was difficult to isolate specific effects because the most effective intervention format (interventions involving group counseling) was tested in trials with similar participant characteristics (girls and women who identified as racial/ethnic minorities), and only 1 trial of adolescents included boys.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation34\">34</a></sup>Thirty-four trials evaluated self-reported behavioral outcomes at least 3 months after interventions started in adolescents, young adults, or older adults, most of whom were at increased risk for STIs (30 trials). Intervention and participant characteristics were similar to those in trials that assessed STI outcomes. Behavioral counseling interventions were effective for increasing condom use, specifically dichotomous measures of consistent condom use or condom use at last sexual encounter (13 trials; n&#8197;=&#8197;5253; OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.10-1.56];&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;40%) and for decreasing unprotected intercourse based on number of sexual acts or days of intercourse without a condom (14 trials; n&#8197;=&#8197;9183; mean difference, &ndash;0.94 [95% CI, &ndash;1.40 to &ndash;0.48];&nbsp;<em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&#8197;=&#8197;16%).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation34\">34</a></sup>Several trials found that interventions with high contact time were significantly associated with increased condom use or reductions in unprotected sex or the number of sex partners.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation34\">34</a></sup>&nbsp;Two interventions with moderate contact time were also significantly associated with increased condom use<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation14\">14</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation35\">35</a></sup>&nbsp;or abstinence from vaginal sex.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation36\">36</a></sup>&nbsp;One intervention with low contact time that sent adolescents and young adults numerous emails with links to STI information and motivational content was significantly associated with a reduction in unprotected sex.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation37\">37</a></sup>&nbsp;Most of the 8 trials that reported both STI acquisition and behavioral outcomes found that persons reporting more consistent condom use were less likely to acquire STIs.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation34\">34</a></sup>Four trials evaluated behavioral counseling interventions in adults or adolescents at average STI risk who were recruited without respect to individual STI risk factors from primary care clinics (3 trials) or through community advertising (1 trial).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation34\">34</a></sup>&nbsp;None reported significant effects on STI acquisition. One trial found a significant effect on self-reported sexual behavior in adolescents aged 11 to 14 years (of whom most were not yet sexually active) who enrolled with their mothers in a multisession family therapy intervention that was endorsed by their clinician and aimed to reduce adolescent sexual activity. After 9 months of follow-up, adolescents in the intervention group were less likely to report vaginal intercourse than adolescents offered usual care (OR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.11-0.55]).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation36\">36</a></sup>&nbsp;A recent follow-up study using an updated version of the intervention in a broader group found similar results.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation38\">38</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Seven of the trials that assessed STI or behavioral outcomes (n&#8197;=&#8197;3458) also reported on potential harms of interventions in adolescents or adults at increased risk for STIs. None of these trials reported significant harms.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation25\">25</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation34\">34</a></sup>&nbsp;There was no consistent evidence that interventions increased sexual activity in adolescents, unintended pregnancy, perceptions of shame or stigma, or mental health problems.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 17, 2019, through January 21, 2020. Many comments requested clarification about taking a sexual history and identifying which adults are considered at increased risk for STIs. In response, the USPSTF added clarifying language to the Risk Assessment section. Comments seeking additional clarification on recommended interventions were also received. Where the USPSTF was able to provide more details, it did so in the Behavioral Counseling Interventions subsection of the Practice Considerations section. Comments also highlighted additional research needs, which have been included in the Research Needs and Gaps section. Some comments requested that the current recommendation discuss HIV preexposure prophylaxis; HIV preexposure prophylaxis is addressed in a separate USPSTF recommendation.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation32\">32</a></sup>&nbsp;A few comments requested clearer guidance on how to provide counseling in situations in which the sexual activity is not in the control of the patient (such as sexual trafficking or abuse). The USPSTF acknowledges the importance of helping persons in this situation, which goes beyond counseling on how to prevent STIs. The USPSTF added a link to relevant resources provided by the CDC in the Additional Tools and Resources section.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Most studies identified by the USPSTF enrolled heterosexual girls, women, and men at increased risk for STI acquisition. More research on counseling interventions to prevent STIs is needed in sexually active boys; pregnant persons; gay, lesbian, bisexual, nonbinary, and transgender persons; and older adults at increased risk; as well as in adolescents who are not yet sexually active. Research on interventions that engage couples or sex partners of primary care patients is also needed. More national-level data on prevalence of STIs in certain risk groups are also needed, including lesbian, bisexual, nonbinary, and transgender persons. Additional research is needed on understanding the role of social determinants of health in contributing to increased STI rates.Few trials incorporated sexual risk assessment performed by primary care clinicians, and less than one-half of trials assessed interventions delivered by clinicians, nurses, psychologists, or other health professionals. Because many trials were conducted in STI clinics, research that is more applicable to general primary care populations would be valuable, such as trials that test interventions delivered in primary care settings, obstetrics clinics, and family planning and women&rsquo;s health clinics, or that is endorsed by primary care clinicians for patients who report increased STI risk based on well-defined risk assessment methods.Trials that follow up participants for longer than 12 months are needed to assess the durability of intervention effects.Research is needed to develop and test interventions that could extend group counseling to remote participants (such as interactive telemedicine) and that would be more feasible for asymptomatic patients in general primary care settings, such as brief or media-based interventions involving less than 30 minutes.</p>\r\n<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>\r\n<p>The CDC recommends that all clinicians routinely obtain a sexual history and encourage abstinence, condom use, limiting number of sex partners, and other sexual risk&ndash;reduction strategies,<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation4\">4</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation39\">39</a></sup>&nbsp;as well as routine vaccination against HPV and HBV infection.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation40\">40</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling#citation41\">41</a></sup>&nbsp;Many organizations advise clinicians to periodically obtain sexual histories, conduct sexual risk assessments, discuss sexual risk reduction, or some combination thereof;

Secondary hypertension in children is most commonly caused by renal or renovascular disease. Other causes of secondary hypertension include congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, genetic disorders, and endocrine disorders.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation6\">6</a></sup>The American Academy of Pediatrics revised its definitions of abnormal blood pressure in children and adolescents in 2017.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup> Hypertension is defined as sustained high blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure (previously known as prehypertension) in children aged 1 to 13 years is defined as 3 auscultatory blood pressure measurements between the 90th and 94th percentile based on age, height, and sex, or 120 to 129/&lt;80 mm Hg.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup> For children aged 1 to 13 years, hypertension is defined as 3 auscultatory blood pressure measurements at 3 different visits that are either equal to or above the 95th percentile based on age, height, and sex or above 130/80 mm Hg, whichever measurement is lower.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup> The thresholds for adolescents 13 years or older follow the adult guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, regardless of sex and height: stage 1 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure measurement of 130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg, and stage 2 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure measurement above 140/90 mm Hg.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation9\">9</a></sup>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\nBest practice is to measure blood pressure by auscultation of the upper right arm with an appropriately sized cuff<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup> at 3 different visits. (The right arm is preferred in children because standardized blood pressure tables reflect right arm readings and because low readings in the left arm could be a result of coarctation of the aorta.) Some organizations suggest that, as in adults, the diagnosis should be confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). ABPM uses portable devices that record blood pressure measurements at regular intervals (usually every 20 to 30 minutes) over 12 to 24 hours.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\nThere is no good evidence about how often blood pressure should be measured in children and adolescents.\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\nHypertension in children is often treated with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. Lifestyle interventions for hypertension include weight loss in children who are overweight or obese, increased physical activity, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, as well as education and counseling. Medication is generally used to treat hypertension that is unresponsive to lifestyle modification or that has a secondary cause.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\nIn deciding whether to screen for high blood pressure in children and adolescents, clinicians should consider the following.\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\nImportant risk factors for primary hypertension in children and adolescents are higher body mass index and a family history of hypertension. Other risk factors include low birth weight, male sex, and African American or Hispanic/Latino race/ethnicity. The increasing prevalence of hypertension in children and adolescents, possibly driven by childhood obesity, suggests that identification and treatment of hypertension may become a significant health care issue. The goal of identifying and treating children and adolescents with primary hypertension can be viewed within a larger framework of adult cardiovascular risk reduction, which includes addressing other biometric risk factors such as higher body mass index and lipid profiles and hyperglycemia. However, the variables for cardiovascular risk reduction in children are less understood than in adults.Extending the adult framework for cardiovascular risk reduction to children and adolescents is limited by several methodological challenges that complicate the determination of the potential preventable burden. There is limited evidence about the clinical and epidemiologic significance of percentile thresholds used in children in terms of their association with adult cardiovascular disease. In addition, the performance characteristics of current methods for diagnosing hypertension during childhood are limited and of concern because of possible high false-positive rates (ie, elevated blood pressure measurements that later normalize).One justification that has been suggested for screening is to identify secondary hypertension, a relatively rare condition. Younger children (younger than 6 years) are more likely than older children and adolescents to have a secondary cause of hypertension, such as renal disease, coarctation of the aorta, or endocrine disease. Secondary hypertension is unlikely to be the only clinical manifestation of the underlying disorder in these cases, and management is primarily targeted at treating the underlying condition, as well as controlling hypertension.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\nClinic-based screening for high blood pressure could result in false-positive results. Thus, unnecessary secondary evaluations or treatments may be common, particularly with frequent blood pressure screening. Pharmacologic interventions have been shown to be well tolerated, but this has only been evaluated in studies over relatively short periods.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup> Treatment of hypertension in childhood and adolescence with pharmacologic agents is done for a much longer period, and therefore, adverse effects may be more likely to occur.\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\nCurrent practice for blood pressure screening typically involves measurement in office-based health care settings as part of well child or sports participation examinations, often in conjunction with other vital signs and growth parameters. Several organizations recommend routine measurement of blood pressure at well child visits starting at age 3 years, based on consensus.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\nThe USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention to improve weight status (B recommendation).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation10\">10</a></sup> The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents 20 years or younger (I statement).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation11\">11</a></sup> These recommendations are available on the USPSTF website (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</div>\r\n<div><br /><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\r\n<script src=\"/uspstf/sites/default/files/js/js_VtafjXmRvoUgAzqzYTA3Wrjkx9wcWhjP0G4ZnnqRamA.js\"></script>\r\n<![endif]-->\r\n<div data-off-canvas-main-canvas=\"\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"bootstrap-panel--7\">\r\n<div id=\"bootstrap-panel--7--content\">\r\n<div id=\"Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation\">This recommendation updates the 2013 recommendation on screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation12\">12</a></sup> This draft is similar to the 2013 recommendation in that the evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms is still insufficient because no direct evidence is available on screening for hypertension in children and adolescents and health outcomes, and limited evidence exists for assessing the harms of screening and treatment.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation12\">12</a></sup></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Six fair-quality RCTs reported similar risks of adverse events between pharmacologic treatments and placebo.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup> Trial duration was only 2 to 4 weeks.

Most treatment studies excluded children with secondary hypertension.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a></sup>\r\n<h3>Primary Hypertension and Health Outcomes</h3>\r\nThe proportion of children with primary hypertension who revert to normal blood pressure over time, without any intervention, and the proportion of those who will continue to have hypertension in adulthood is unknown. Persistent elevation of blood pressure in adults is an established risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders and renal impairment. However, these conditions are often distant future events for children and adolescents. Children with primary hypertension are at higher risk of developing intermediate outcomes such as increased left ventricular mass and carotid intima-media thickness.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation5\">5</a></sup> As a result, intermediate measures of target end-organ injury, including physical alterations to the structure of vascular walls (early atherosclerosis or thickening of arteries) and the heart (increased left ventricle mass) and altered renal function (microalbuminuria), are often studied. At present, the evidence about the relationship between high blood pressure or intermediate outcomes in children and the presence of hypertension and intermediate outcomes in adults is inconsistent.Screening for high blood pressure in younger children may lead to the diagnosis of secondary hypertension and its underlying etiologies that are responsive to treatment. However, no evidence exists that demonstrates whether screening for high blood pressure is effective in identifying asymptomatic children with secondary hypertension. In addition, treatment studies exclude children with secondary hypertension.\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 21 to May 18, 2020. Comments requested clarification about secondary hypertension. In response, the USPSTF added clarifying language to the Supporting Evidence and the How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding? sections. Comments seeking additional language on harms were also received. The USPSTF provided more details in the Supporting Evidence and the Research Needs and Gaps sections. A respondent commented on the lack of attention to health inequities. The USPSTF added language to the Research Needs and Gaps section.</div>\r\n<div>There are several critical evidence gaps in understanding the potential net benefit of screening for high blood pressure in childhood and adolescence.

These studies should have long-term follow-up of several months or years across various age groups because benefits and harms of treatments may be age dependent and hypertension in children may be self-limiting.</li>\r\n<li>The benefits and harms of screening and treatment should also include children at increased risk, such as Black and Hispanic/Latino populations.</li>\r\n<li>The long-term natural history of hypertension in children and the spontaneous resolution of hypertension.</li>\r\n<li>The associations among childhood hypertension, adulthood hypertension, and surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood, as well as adulthood clinical cardiovascular disease.</li>\r\n<li>The harms of medications, long-term adherence with treatment, and the effect of individual components of multifactorial interventions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all patients for hypertension annually and high-risk patients at each visit beginning at age 3 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation1\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup> It also recommends using ABPM for the confirmation of hypertension in children and adolescents.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation8\">8</a></sup> The American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommend routine screening starting at age 3 years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation24\">24</a>,<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation25\">25</a></sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians states that there is insufficient evidence for or against routine screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents.<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation26\">26</a></sup></div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div data-off-canvas-main-canvas=\"\">\r\n<div id=\"bootstrap-panel--6\">\r\n<div id=\"bootstrap-panel--6--content\">\r\n<div id=\"Practice Considerations\">The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention to improve weight status (B recommendation).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation10\">10</a></sup> The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents 20 years or younger (I statement).<sup><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening#citation11\">11</a></sup> These recommendations are available on the USPSTF website (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772761\">Screening for High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents: JAMA Patient Page</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",
